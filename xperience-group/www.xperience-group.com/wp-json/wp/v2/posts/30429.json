Other than the implementation of a single piece of software like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/accounts-erp-software\/\">ERP<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/crm-software\/\">CRM<\/a>, digital transformation is the process of completely digitising your business processes, your way of operating and even your mindset. Digital transformation gives your company the opportunity to reshape the organization, modernise the business processes and how your employees work together, improve your products and services and put your customers as the central focus of everything you do.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s world, customers have the power. The transparency of the internet gives them the possibility to switch to an alternative vendor within just a few clicks. These modern customers also have huge expectations regarding topics like pro-activity, transparency, speed, clarity and quality. The pressure to provide good customer experience is even higher as any mistake or bad experience can be quickly communicated to the public via social media and review websites.<\/p>\n<p>For all companies who are putting their customers, prospects, members or citizens at the heart of the organisation, modernising business processes and brushing up internal mindsets is nothing less than a crucial move to secure a healthy future!<\/p>\n<p>The number one fail factor for digital transformation projects however, is transferring all your existing business processes, the outdated reports, the crude data and the old way of thinking from an on-premise situation to the cloud. Continuing to use your old processes and traditional mindset after embracing digital is the equivalent of keeping old wine in new bottles. Companies that select this scenario run the risk of losing time, budget, energy and momentum.<\/p>\n<p>Successful digital transformation projects starts in the boardroom and not in your IT department!<\/p>\n<p>Some of the crucial elements for achieving transformation success are a clear vision, true management engagement, time and budget for organisational change and good communication.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the impression that digital transformation is \u201cjust another IT project\u201d, then it is high time to take action. Seek inspiration. Read books. Attend workshops. And make sure that your top management is fully involved!<br \/>\nAfter all, it is better to gain these insights before the project starts than once the project has failed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/digital-transformation\/\">Find out more about digital transformation here &gt;&gt;&gt;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital transformation is often too closely linked to just technology with less focus on technology\u2019s ability to improve business functions.
