We carried out 28 free educational webinars with 400 attendees from across the UK to help our clients maximise the systems they already have while working from home.<\/p>\n<p>We were delighted to host these webinars, which included topics such as data security, collaboration, reporting, and productivity tools. It\u2019s been a great way to stay connected with our clients and share our knowledge when it\u2019s needed most.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/remote-working-webinar-series\/\">For more on our webinar series, click here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Launching a new podcast series<\/h2>\n<p>Podcasts were a new venture for us in 2020, but one we were excited to try. It is important to us that our clients feel supported, especially in these extraordinary times, so we wanted to pass on our expertise through a forum that best suited them in the new era of remote working.<\/p>\n<p>We launched our new Digital Transformation podcast on Podbean which saw our experts and Senior Leadership Team step up and talk to other experts and clients on their digital transformation journey across CRM, ERP, Managed IT, and Cloud.<\/p>\n<p>We are excited to continue this journey in 2021, but to check out our podcast series to date, <a href=\"https:\/\/xperienceit.podbean.com\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>7 new products and services and achieving ISO 27001:2013 security accreditation<\/h2>\n<p>With everything that went down in 2020, one thing that we kept up, was our passion to continually innovate and expand our offering to our clients so that their data is always supported and secure in this ever-changing digital landscape. Last year seen an unprecedented increase in cybersecurity threats and on average our data centre teams blocked over 1 million malicious requests each day! So, over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve introduced a range of security solutions that have allowed our clients to access previously unattainable levels of protection from the latest cybersecurity threats. One of the new services, is our new Modern Workplace Security Bundle which is delivered through a flexible and convenient monthly subscription. This provides access to industry-leading technologies and tools, to help our clients to prepare, detect, and defend against the latest cybersecurity threats.<\/p>\n<p>As part of our security efforts, Xperience is also ISO 27001:2013 certified, which demonstrates that we have comprehensive security policies, procedures and physical security measures in place to meet international security standards. Thanks to the dedication of our team, we\u2019re delighted to have met this standard for the sixth year in a row!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/cybersecurity\/\">For more about our cybersecurity, click here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Major new release of Contracts365<\/h2>\n<p>After 12 months of development, Contracts365 has now moved into Microsoft Dynamics Business Central. The new version provides customers with enhanced functionality, quicker deployment times and improved integration with other Microsoft products.<\/p>\n<h2>Continuing cloud growth<\/h2>\n<p>How we work changed overnight in 2020, so we had to think about how we could accommodate the demand on the cloud to support our customers and to enable the development of new products and services. To do this, we launched our fourth cloud computing platform in London. However, we didn\u2019t stop there \u2013 we also doubled our connectivity footprint to increase performance and resilience and we introduced two new virtualisation technologies, which allow us to deliver more customised solutions for our clients.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xperience-group.com\/cloud-computing-solutions\/\">For more on our cloud solutions, click here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Giving back to our community<\/h2>\n<p>Although we haven\u2019t been able to take part in the usual staff fundraising events throughout the year, we made the month of December all about giving back. We knew we couldn\u2019t do our usual employee Christmas celebrations, so we opted to run several virtual events like cocktails and bingo, Santa\u2019s scavenger hunt, a riddle a day, etc. Donations were welcomed for the attendance of every virtual event.<\/p>\n<p>Our team raised over \u00a31000 in less than a month for Trussell Trust, which supports a nationwide network of food banks to stop families in the UK from going hungry.
