										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>What is cyber security?</strong></h2>
<p>Cyber Security is defined as ‘how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber-attacks throughout their business’. Its main function within an organisation is to protect the devices used such as computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones and the data they hold.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/blogs-cyber-security-checklist-10-questions-for-the-modern-managing-director/">cyber security</a> approach should be a multi-layered defense solution that should work to not only prevent unauthorised access to a persons or businesses personal data but also to detect attacks when they happen and help the organisation recover efficiently and effectively.</p>
<h2><strong>How has it changed?</strong></h2>
<p>Over the years, cyber security has become a growing priority for businesses due to the changing digital landscape within which they operate; social selling, online banking, and remote working have all become the “norm.” With these technology driven advancements, organisations have undertaken digital transformation programmes which have increased their digital footprint and increased their vulnerability to cybercrime. Alongside this, cybercriminals themselves have become more sophisticated with their attacks, using tool such as AI, bots, ransomware, malware, and spyware.</p>
<h2><strong>Top 5 Cyber Security Facts you should know &#8211; </strong></h2>
<p>Phishing emails have increased by over 600% in the last year – <a href="https://www.fintechnews.org/the-2020-cybersecurity-stats-you-need-to-know/">Fintech News</a></p>
<p>304 million ransomware attacks occurred worldwide in 2020. A 62% t increase YoY &#8211; Statista</p>
<p>92% of malware is delivered by email <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html">CSO</a>,2020</p>
<p>Four in ten businesses (39%) reported having cyber security breaches or attacks in the last 12 months. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2021/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2021">Gov.uk,</a> 2021</p>
<p>In the UK, businesses have lost over £6.2 million due to cyber-scams over the past year &#8211; <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/gdpr-policy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitymagazine.com%2Farticles%2F93722-uk-sees-a-31-increase-in-cyber-crime-amid-the-pandemic">Security Magazine</a>, 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>What should Cyber Security look like for my business?</strong></h2>
<p>Cyber security has come a long way from when computers and new technologies first came into the business world.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few tips to help you identify your cyber security needs for your business &#8211;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Employee Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Engage with your employees to find out how they use their devices day to day. Once you’ve identified how they use their devices and their work practices, carry out some employee training and mitigation solutions. It is estimated that “Worldwide cybercrime costs will hit $6 trillion annually by 2021” <a class="Hyperlink SCXW221477861 BCX0" href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/top-5-cybersecurity-facts-figures-predictions-and-statistics-for-2019-to-2021/#:~:text=1%20cyber%2Dattacked%20industry%20%E2%80%94%20will,fastest%20growing%20type%20of%20cybercrime." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="TextRun Underlined SCXW221477861 BCX0" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW221477861 BCX0" data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Cybersecurityventures,</span></span></a>2021.</p>
<p><strong>Consider new technologies</strong></p>
<p>Employ new technologies into your business’s cyber security plan, whether that involves backing your data up in cloud services, or ensuring you have the latest security software protecting you from viruses, malware, and other online threats. Studies show that “80% of enterprise IT will move to the cloud by 2025” <a class="Hyperlink BCX0 SCXW137335927" href="https://partners.wsj.com/oracle/prediction-80-percent-of-enterprise-it-will-move-to-the-cloud-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="TextRun Underlined BCX0 SCXW137335927" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun BCX0 SCXW137335927" data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">The Wall Street Journal,</span></span></a>2021.</p>
<p><strong>Passwords and authentication</strong></p>
<p>Identify how your employee&#8217;s password protect their devices and how regularly they update them. Depending on their level of access required, consider introducing multi-factor authentication to help secure devices and apps. Multi-factor authentication should be used to protect sensitive data such as financial or customer information.</p>
<p><strong>Implement VPN connections</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are working between office locations or remote working, it’s important for your business to consider virtual private network (VPN) connections. This will help reduce the risk to your organisations’ network and vulnerabilities to a cyber-attack. <a class="Hyperlink BCX0 SCXW185344535" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/542817/worldwide-virtual-private-network-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="TextRun Underlined BCX0 SCXW185344535" lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun BCX0 SCXW185344535" data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">Statista</span></span></a> estimates that the VPN market is expected to surpass $92 billion in 2027.</p>
<p><strong>Be prepared to invest</strong></p>
<p>For many businesses throughout the UK,  remote working and hybrid working has become a new trend that seems to be staying for the foreseeable future. A recent report from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time">Gartner </a>suggests that “82% of business leaders will let their employees work remotely in a flexible capacity”. With new trends and having to adapt to new situations, it’s important for all businesses to invest in their cyber security, whether that involves auditing your current processes or identifying what needs updated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.If you suffered a ransomware attack, could you get back up and running or would you be forced to pay the <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/how-to-avoid-ransomware-cyber-security-tips/">ransomware</a>?</strong></p>
<p>The average ransom paid in 2020 was $170,404 with a third of victims paying up (Source – <a href="https://secure2.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware.aspx">The State of Ransomware 2021</a> by Sophos).</p>
<p><strong>2.If you are confident that you can you get back up and running, how long would it take for your business to get back online, and what would the impact be?</strong></p>
<p>Ransomware recovery timeframes can vary widely. In very unusual situations, companies may only down for a day or two. In other unusual cases, it can take weeks. Most companies fall somewhere between the one to four-week range, given their struggle with not knowing what they are doing. In a well-managed ransomware recovery effort—being executed by an experienced team—a common time frame is one to two weeks. However, there are a tremendous number of variables to consider and it is important to state that “recovery” is defined here as getting the IT system back online so the company can transact business.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should disaster strike, do you have sufficient internal IT resources available to quickly and efficiently restore access to your environment?</strong></p>
<p>This could be internal resources or third-party suppliers. But remember that if you are reliant on a third-party supplier they may not have available resources to deal with your cyber-attack. The supplier could be mid-project work or even dealing with other attacks.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you really understand the threat of Cyber Security?</strong></p>
<p>Too many people believe that it’s about anti-virus software and think that they are covered as they have this in place. It’s not. Cyber security is multi-layered and having anti-virus software alone will not protect you. As a minimum you should be undertaken a vulnerability assessment. It’s no different to securing physical premises. You’ll have physical deterring security measures such as multiple locks, alarms and gates. You’ll have measures for dealing with catastrophes such as fire and flooding. You’ll train staff in how to handle different scenarios to protect your business and employee’s welfare. You need to do the same with the threat of cyber attacks.</p>
<p><strong>5.Would you suffer reputational damage if you suffered an attack?</strong></p>
<p>What would customers, suppliers and other stakeholders think if you suffered an attack and were unable to trade for a number of days or weeks. Would your customer base or supply chain be impacted?</p>
<p><strong>6. Are you complying with the terms of your business insurance policies?</strong></p>
<p>As ransomware soars, insurers are trying to reduce their exposures by increasing their minimum security level requirements for each of their renewing and new business clients. Security measures that were a preference a year ago are now seen as mandatory and unless businesses take immediate steps to remedy any outstanding minimum standards, they may find it significantly harder, if not impossible, to obtain cyber cover.</p>
<p>Underwriting controls that are being mandated by the cyber markets have become more robust, but the list of controls is by no means static. Minimum standards evolve as technological processes advance and as cyber criminals’ tactics change.</p>
<p><strong>Current minimum-security measures include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> On all remote access, administrator accounts, RDP, emails and any other area in which this can be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Endpoint protection software:</strong> For detection and response to malicious attacks on laptops, phones etc.</p>
<p><strong>Server backups to the cloud and offsite locations:</strong> To allow a company to have something to fall back on in case of severe data encryption.</p>
<p><strong>Frequent training of employees;</strong> especially around data protection and cyber threat e.g. Email phishing links.</p>
<p>In our experience, insurance renewals are often left until very late in the renewal cycle. Don’t get caught out and find that you can’t get cyber insurance protection because you have not addressed core cyber security requirements.</p>
<p><strong>7. Have you assessed whether remote working increases your risk of cyber security attacks?</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an increase in staff working remotely in either a full time or hybrid manner. Have you assessed whether this increases the risk of cyber security attacks to your organisation. Home connections are typically far less secure meaning that cyber criminals have an easier entry into business networks.</p>
<p><strong>8. Are your staff trained to deal with and prevent possible cyber breaches?</strong></p>
<p>Comprehensive cyber security awareness training is one of the best ways to help protect your business from malicious actors and prevent possible breaches. Your employees are often the first line of defense against a cyber security attack. Well-trained employees know the best tactics to prevent, respond to, and recover from an attack. The training should cover 4 key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>defending yourself against phishing</li>
<li>using strong passwords</li>
<li>securing your devices</li>
<li>reporting incidents (&#8216;if in doubt, call it out&#8217;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Is my patch management up to date and do I have outdated hardware that is a risk?</strong></p>
<p>Patches are designed to repair a vulnerability or flaw identified after an application or software is released. Unpatched software can make the device a vulnerable target of exploits. Software patches are a critical component of IT operations and security and it is essential that you have policies and procedures for ensuring that these are adopted</p>
<p><strong>10. When was the last time you actively assessed the vulnerability and risk of cyber security to your business?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s be honest! We’re all busy struggling with busy workloads and what we believe are the immediate pressing business issues. Cyber security is all very technical and it’s probably not something that non-IT experts feel comfortable dealing with. However, it’s not something that can be ignored and is one of the key risks facing businesses in 2021.</p>

<h3 aria-level="2"><strong>Microsoft Teams Webinar Functionality </strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Alongside the existing schedule meeting and live events options, Microsoft Teams now allows you to host a Webinar.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You can ask attendees to register for an upcoming event, which replaces the need to use 3rd party registration tools such as Eventbrite. As a part of the functionality, you get a registration and attendee report, from within the meeting dashboard itself. What’s more, you can have up to 7 presenters, brand the lobby with your company logo, and access a custom dashboard detailing registrations and attendance data!</span></p>

<h3 aria-level="3"><strong>Client Case Study – Georgia Kennedy – Marketing Executive @ Smiley Monroe comments: </strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Microsoft Teams has transformed how Smiley Monroe communicates both internally and externally.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“Before the pandemic, Smiley Monroe relied heavily on face-to-face customer interaction to help solve problems and build long trusting relationships. Once Covid hit, suddenly that face-to-face interaction in the traditional sense was taken away. &#8220;We didn’t want to miss out on all of the conversations that our physical tradeshows or customer visits allowed us to have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">“So we turned to the virtual world of Microsoft Teams – all of a sudden we could have those face-to-face conversations again (albeit virtual) no matter where our customers were located – USA or India – in the office or at home, we could stay connected. Last December, we launched our first webinar series to talk about problems that our customers face and the solutions that Smiley Monroe could offer. It was such a success that we started a series with our third webinar going live tomorrow. Microsoft Teams has provided us with a platform to present our webinars and enable us to have those important conversations and remain close to our customers. “</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Live Polls are a great way of gauging reactions of not just your clients but your internal stakeholders as well. By adding a poll at the start of a meeting, you can gauge feedback on meetings as they happen without breaking up the flow by stopping and asking questions.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has opened the eyes of many businesses to the importance of maintaining and building customer relationships. And it’s not just retailers, other sectors have realised the need for their CRM systems in order to manage sales and serve customers. But, one of the key factors behind <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/crm-software-statistics/">the growth of CRM</a> software is accessibility, giving businesses access to customer data in real-time, away from office, with cloud solutions leading the way.</p>
<h3>Why is the growth of CRM software market prediction so huge?</h3>
<p>During the pandemic it has become crucial for businesses to talk to their customers more than ever before to continue to build on those relationships. Competition for customers is high no matter the size of the business or industry and if businesses don’t look after their customers and provide an excellent experience from onboarding right through to support, their competitors will.</p>
<p>As a result, in parallel with the rise in demand for CRM, digital transformation has accelerated during the pandemic. Digital transformation is all about putting your customers and data at the heart of your business and CRM is a key tenet of helping businesses achieve this. What is more, CRM helps builds better customer relationships that are personalised, giving businesses the ability to learn from their customers and use those valuable insights for continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Integrating CRM software with other business applications will also unify business data, which gives businesses the ability to get predictive insights, remove data silos, duplicate data, and save time.</p>
<h3>CRM adoption during the pandemic – the benefits and potential obstacles</h3>
<p>The customer will ultimately be the clear winner, as the CRM adoption continues to increase, with service levels significantly improving.</p>
<p>As for the obstacles, many businesses still don’t see the value of <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/crm-software/">CRM systems</a> and if they do, they are not using them to maximise their relationships with their customers. This can range from businesses not adopting CRM systems and using spreadsheets through to not updating the data correctly in the system. The data contained in CRM is a critical component of success. The time has come where it is embrace CRM or die for many businesses.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the younger generation coming into the workplace will drive CRM to new heights. Their ability to adopt technology at a faster pace will no doubt contribute to the exponential growth that we will see for CRM.</p>
<h3>What does the future of CRM software look like?</h3>
<p>AI-centric CRM platforms will be the future to help provide real-time insights into customer behaviour, identifying buying patterns that turn them into opportunities. And, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-barriers-to-ai-adoption/">Gartner’s CIO Agenda</a><em> survey, 14% of global CIOs have already deployed AI, and it’s estimated that AI associated with CRM activities will boost global business revenue by $1.1 trillion by the end of 2021. </em></p>
<p>What is more, AI will go hand in hand with voice recognition technology, from an accessibility point of view. According to <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/2019/07/22/voice-assistant-statistics-trends-2019.html#gs.3a5wl3">Adobe’s research on voice technology</a>, 94% of users consider voice technology easy to use and say it does more than save time – it improves their quality of life. Therefore, voice technology will help sales to track and update customer data. Marketing and service teams will be able to track conversations and analyse the meaning behind the words to understand customers even more.</p>
<h3>CRM is not just CRM</h3>
<p>CRM is the new automation tool. The leading CRM software tools such as <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/microsoft-dynamics-365-crm/">Microsoft Dynamics 365</a> workflows reduce administration overhead to create efficient processes across the business for sales, service, marketing and other teams. For example, chatbots can be used to communicate with customers and solve simple customer queries or automated email workflows can be created to nurture sales prospects down the funnel.</p>
<p>CRM is more than just a sales management tool too. It can be used by every function across a business including <strong>sales, marketing, finance, HR, service, operations, commerce,</strong> and more. For example, a marketing team can use CRM software to understand the contacts in their pipeline and the conversion rates, while the key account managers can get a 360 view of the customer helping them cross-sell and upsell.  Moreover, management teams can get a cockpit view of all the valuable data and performance across their business.</p>
<h3>Social and Mobile CRM</h3>
<p>By viewing social media and CRM together, organisations can gain a more powerful overview of what people are posting about them on social media and by communicating with customers on their preferred channels.</p>
<p>Moreover, Forrester statistics have shown that 50% of teams improved their productivity by using a mobile CRM. Be it WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, brands can respond seamlessly in the way that suits their customers best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the globe, clients that require a successful digital transformation project have one thing in common. They want their favourite solutions to be delivered, implemented and supported faster, cheaper and better. Unfortunately, practice shows every time that only two of these three compelling goals can be realised at the same time and in the same project. This is often referred to as the devil’s triangle. If you are such a customer who also wants everything at once, you better start preparing for some serious choices. And get ready to understand the impact of these choices for your implementation process, your organisation and your budgets!</p>
<p>It may be helpful to dive a bit deeper into each of the three aspects before you make the selection of your preferred variables. After all, you must be able to understand the contribution of each of these aspects on a successful digital transformation project.</p>
<p><strong>Faster.</strong> You can deploy modern, cloud-based ERP/CRM software in a matter of minutes. Today’s solutions can configure themselves and they are even able to convert the data. But that is just the technology! The human side is a different story. With a completely different timeline. Implementing the processes, introducing new ones and inspiring (or sometimes convincing) employees takes way more time. Not to mention the impact of a disruptive business model, where you might want to rethink all your current processes. It doesn’t take long to implement an <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/accounts-erp-software/">ERP</a> or <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/crm-software/">CRM</a> system badly. But implementing a solution successfully simply takes time.</p>
<p>The desire to implement fast is often a result of delaying difficult decisions. You can prevent this by taking your important decisions consistently on time.</p>
<p><strong>Cheaper.</strong> It’s obvious that nobody wants to pay more for a successful project than strictly necessary. But does that justify the constant search for the cheapest way? Some of the more prevalent attempts we see are selecting a solution with limited prospects for continuity, insufficient time for the project preparation, making savings on the budgets for organisational change, selecting the wrong key-users and poor communication. But as with everything in life, quality comes with a price.</p>
<p>Good is of course the basis of every project success. So this should really be the leading theme in all the discussions you will have and decisions you will make. It’s a great help when you’re able to make this project the most important one in your organisation and to agree that no other projects will be started during the implementation.</p>
<p>Probably the best advise that we can give you is to focus on just one of these three elements, and that element is good. After all, the implementation of your new solution forms the basis for your future business success and that is crucial for attracting and retaining both customers and employees. So, don’t be tempted to rush or to make it cheap just for the sake of time or money budgets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s markets, there are not many organisations who can allow their next <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/digital-transformation/">Digital Transformation</a> initiative to fail whether that is cloud, ERP, CRM or something else. Unfortunately, there is a persistent misunderstanding that the preparation involved in successful project management only starts when a system is shown and you are connected to suppliers. But are you aware that the most important decisions that determine success or failure are taken in the beginning of the preparation stage? So where do you lay the foundation for your next successful project?</p>
<p>Major shifts have occurred in the past 5 to 10 years in the success and failure factors for software implementation projects. Over time, these factors have shifted from purely technical aspects (think: system failures and performance) towards organisational aspects including the willingness and ability to change business processes, mindset and company culture. With this shift, it makes sense to take a completely different approach to your preparation phase.</p>
<p>A solid preparation for an organisational project starts much earlier compared with the traditional, more technology-driven projects. Due to the nature of today’s projects, there is an urgent need to include different roles in your project. Ideally, the main principles and preconditions for the project should already be determined before contact is made with suppliers.</p>
<p>Here are some important questions which are ideally answered in your preparation phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the strategic goals that we want to achieve with this initiative?</li>
<li>How can we define these goals in an attractive format so that every single employee can understand them?</li>
<li>How can we secure active involvement from the complete management team?</li>
<li>Who is the active and skilled sponsor at on-board level that will be responsible for both success and (unhoped-for) failure?</li>
<li>Will this project be the only project with a 100 percent focus or will there be more projects running at the same time?</li>
<li>Are we adapting the new software to the way we work or are we open to change our business processes towards the best practices in the software?</li>
<li>Are we opting for a ‘big-bang’ approach or a series of ‘baby steps’ a better approach?</li>
<li>Where are the greatest risks of failure and how can we limit or even eliminate them?</li>
<li>How can we motivate our teams to share their best ideas with the project team?</li>
<li>How can we use communication so that we involve the entire company at an early stage?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is of course of crucial importance to share the answers to these questions with the complete organisation. An additional advantage of this approach is that you are able to inform your potential vendors and implementation partners in a much better way about what you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Preparation is always ninety percent of successful project management. So, there is a good chance that this new approach will contribute to better project results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, there is a multitude of reasons to create huge digital implementation projects. To be honest, each and every single argument to add to your project scope can make sense, there is no doubt about that!</p>
<p>Sure, this situation is tempting! You work with an older, outdated<a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/accounts-erp-software/"> ERP</a> or CRM solution that needs to be replaced urgently. Or you use an older version of a modern solution and there is pressure to upgrade to the latest version. Of course, this is also the perfect moment to modernise your legacy business processes and fix the broken ones. Needless to say, your data needs to be cleansed. Your end-users must be trained and inspired to get more out of the available functionality than in the current system. And yes – with this long-awaited move, a wealth of innovative new technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things finally comes within reach. After all, you don’t want to miss the boat, right?</p>
<p>However, the question is what have you learned from the ERP or <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/crm-software/">CRM</a> digital  implementation projects that we’ve seen in the past say 40 to 50 years.</p>
<p>To help with your thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers are often optimistic when it comes to estimating their available time, skill sets, focus and motivation</li>
<li>During the implementation, it’s not easy to stick to the initial plan</li>
<li>Implementation projects have the tendency to take longer than expected</li>
<li>These so called<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-bang-vs-phased-erp-implementation-strategies-sorosh-saberian/"> ‘big-bang’ implementations</a> have caused disruption and sometimes even temporarily paralysed entire organisations</li>
<li>In today’s fast changing world, initial project principles can quickly become outdated</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion is that huge and long-lasting digital implementation projects with a wide and flexible project scope are ineffective. Unfortunately it is more often than not that the problems become greater than the benefits and the possible disruption of your day-to-day operation can cause a reduction of customer loyalty, or even worse.</p>
<p>Implementing new software, adapting and modernising your business processes and creating a fresh, new company culture means an enormous effort for your organisation and it demands a lot from your teams. Especially because you also have a business to run. So the alternative for a big-bang approach is to split the project into several smaller steps. And have the discipline to stick to the plan.</p>
<p>A series of smaller project steps delivers numerous advantages. A shorter ‘time-to-value’ and the possibility to adapt more quickly to changing circumstances are certainly two of them.</p>
<p>In today’s fast changing world, we all have to get used to constant change. Change as the only constant. So, you no longer have to implement a perfect ERP or CRM solution that you then use for 5 or 10 years. It’s more effective to consider your digital transformation journey as a process rather than a project, and most likely as a process that is never completely finished.</p>
<p>Approaching your next ERP or CRM project in this way is a great move towards this new way of thinking and working.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the growing role of information technology in our daily lives, it can be no surprise that we all appreciate the value of good quality internal IT systems. That is of course relevant in our private lives, but even more in a business environment. After all, modern office workers spend large parts of their working day behind their PC or laptop – especially when working from home-office! A recent study shows that office workers value well-implemented systems. Around 80% of the respondents indicate that information technology determines whether he or she can work optimally. Increasingly, bad solutions and poor implementations are a strong reason not to choose a new job or to leave an existing employer.</p>
<p>The quality of internal IT systems at an organisation can make or break an employment relationship. For a third of the youngest generation of employees, the millennials, positive feedback about the IT used in an organization is a reason to start working somewhere. For a third of all employees, tech stress and restrictive IT systems can be frustrating enough to find another job.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.workfront.com/en-gb/campaigns/state-of-work">‘2021 State of Work’</a> by Workfront, a subsidiary of Adobe, shows that there are differences between countries and generations when it comes to decisions involving IT frustration or positive experiences. 37% of all millennials take the quality of internal IT systems into a decision to work somewhere, compared to 26% of Generation X. 50% of British and American employees indicate that they want to leave their organisation if information systems restrict them versus only 25% of the Germans employees.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that knowledge workers find well-designed information systems important to their work. Around 80 percent indicate that information technology is (very) important to improve their productivity. Only engaged managers are considered more valuable. A third indicate that he or she could be more productive and engaged if IT provided better support. Examples of this support are better information provision for planning &amp; prioritisation, for remote collaboration, with an intuitive user interface and by automating everyday routine tasks.</p>
<p>IT is also considered important to be able to work well together. Around 60%  of the respondents say they depend on information technology. For example because of collaboration, work management, communication and planning &amp; organisation. Additionally, 80% of those surveyed consider teamwork essential to stay in a job.</p>
<p>With the continued aging of their teams, winning the hearts of young and talented new employees is a crucial factor for many organisations. So if you want to be successful in that ongoing ‘war for talent’, it makes sense to make sure that your <a href="https://www.xperience-group.com/digital-transformation/xperience-solutions/">IT solutions,</a> your business processes and the internal collaboration are nothing less than perfect.</p>
