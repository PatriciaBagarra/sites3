        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">The Quiz Collective, Inc. (doing business as Interact) (“Interact”, “<em>we</em>” or “<em>us</em>”) provides tools for creating online quizzes to help grow businesses. This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect from you or about you, including when you use our website located at www.tryinteract.com (the “<em>Site</em>”) or use our services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our “<em>Services</em>”), contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected online through or in connection with our Services. Unless otherwise stated below, this Privacy Policy does not apply to offline collection of information or activities outside of our Services.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Additionally, if you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under California law.  Therefore, please review section 7. If you reside in the EU, you may have additional rights under EU law and can refer to section 8.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">To better understand what information is most relevant to you, we have provided some useful definitions.</p>
        <ul class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Client.</span> You hold an account with us to create and conduct quizzes, polls, or promotions using our Services.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Website Visitor.</span> You are visiting our Site but have not signed up for an account with us or otherwise interacted with Interact.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Respondents.</span> You have received or participated in an online Quiz, poll, or promotion from us on behalf of one of our Clients or, in some instances, on our own behalf.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Quiz.</span> “Quiz” refers to an online quiz, poll, or promotion created by a Client using Interact Services.  In some limited instances, Interact may make available and administer a Quiz on its own behalf.  When we do so the Quiz page will so indicate or include a link with additional information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">The personal information we collect and how we use it may differ if you are a Client, Respondent or Website Visitor so we make these distinctions in this Privacy Policy, where applicable.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by posting a revised version of the policy to the Site with the updated revision date and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification).  If the changes are material, we will provide notice of the changes on the Site prior to the changes becoming effective. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

        <p id="collection-of-information" class="heading-md color-blue font-style-campaign" style="font-weight: 300;">1. Collection of Information</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">The types of personal information we may collect and how we collect it may vary based on your relationship with us.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or (where required by applicable law) household.  Personal information does not include publicly available information or information that has been de-identified, as defined by applicable laws.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Information You Provide Us</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We collect information you provide directly to us, which may include contact information, like your name or email address, and any other information you choose to provide.  For example, you share information directly with us when you subscribe to our newsletter or sign up for our email updates, fill out a webform on our Site, respond to one of our Client’s Quizzes or Interact’s own Quizzes, request customer support, or when you otherwise communicate with us (e.g., chat).</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Other Information We Collect When You Use Our Services</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your activities, including:</p>
        <ul class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Device and Usage Information:</span>  We collect information about how you access our Services, including data about the device and network you use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app version. We also collect information about your activity on our Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:</span>  We (and our service providers) use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you.  Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits.  Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.  For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see the <a href="#your-choices" class="color-pink">Your Choices</a> section below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Information We Collect from Other Sources</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We may collect information about you from third parties where, for example, you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us or where you have made that information publicly available online. Our Clients may provide us with information about you to manage our relationship with the Client or administer Quizzes on their behalf.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Information We Derive</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we or our partners collect. For example, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address or infer that you are looking to purchase certain products based on your browsing behavior.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Respondents Information</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">When we manage a Quiz on behalf of our Client, the information Respondents provide in completing the Quiz (“Quiz Information”) is controlled by the Client. In those instances, Quiz Information is governed by the privacy practices of the Client.  Therefore, please review the applicable Client’s privacy policy or notice outlining how your information will be collected, used, stored, used, and managed.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">There may be instances where we create our own Quizzes on our own behalf.  If you complete one of our own Quizzes, your responses and all such Quiz Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Additional Information We May Collect If You Are a Client</p>
        <ul class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Registration information:</span> You need an Interact account before you can use our Services. When you register for an account, we collect your contact details and account credentials, which may include your first and last name, company name, work email address, and account password or token-based authentication information.</li>

          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Transactional Information:</span> When you sign up for an Interact account, purchase one of our plans or cancel your account or plan, we collect information about the transaction, such as plan details, purchase price, and date of the transaction.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Quiz Information:</span> We store your Respondents’ Quiz Information (questions and responses) for you and provide analytics tools for you to use with respect to this information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Links</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Our Site may contain links to third-party websites, including those of our business partners. Those websites may have their own privacy policies or no privacy policies at all. Interact is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by third-party websites, and those websites have not agreed to this privacy policy.

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Sharing of Information from Respondents</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Respondents’ Quiz responses and any other Quiz Information are owned and managed by our Client who generated the specific Quiz.  Interact processes your personal information on behalf of its Client and treats Quiz Information as private to the Client, except if the Client has made the questions and responses available via a public link or otherwise authorizes disclosure to other third parties. Please contact the Client directly for more information about the Client’s use of Quiz Information and their privacy practices generally. Interact does not sell personal information related to Quiz responses.  Additionally, Interact does not use Respondent contact details collected in our Client’s Quizzes to contact Respondents, without the Client’s authorization.</p>

        <p id="advertising-and-analytics" class="heading-md color-blue font-style-campaign" style="font-weight: 300;">4. Advertising and Analytics</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile apps.  These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, links clicked, and conversion information.  This information may be used by Interact and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.  For more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" class="color-pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.  </p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of customized campaigns on third-party platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter). As part of these ad campaigns, we or third-party platforms may convert information about you, such as your email address and phone number, into a unique value that can be matched with a user account on these platforms to allow us to learn about your interests and serve you advertising that is customized to your interest. Note that the third-party platforms may offer you choices about whether you see these types of customized ads.</p>

        <p id="use-of-our-services-outside-us" class="heading-md color-blue font-style-campaign" style="font-weight: 300;">5. Use of Our Services Outside U.S.</p>

If you are visiting the Site or using our Services from a location outside of the United States (“U.S.”), All personal information we collect will be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States and/or European Union (“E.U”). All information you receive from the Site will be created, and all information you provide will be maintained on servers and systems located within the U.S. or in Europe. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">The privacy and data protection laws in the U.S. may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your information may be subject to access requests from governmental authorities, courts, or law enforcement according to laws of the United States. By using our Services or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, use, sharing and storage of such information in the U.S. and in other countries, as may be set forth in this privacy policy.</p>

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Account Information</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If you are a Client or other individual with whom we have a direct business relationship, you may update and correct certain account information you provide to us at any time by logging into your account or emailing us at help@tryinteract.com.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If you wish to delete your account, please contact us via email at privacy@tryinteract.com but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">To help us serve you better, we collect information that identifies the computer or browser used to access our Services, as well as the user account associated with that computer/browser if you are logged in.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Certain cookies placed by our Services do not collect any personal information and are essential to provision of a functional website and/or app, which we have a legitimate interest in providing (these are known as “Necessary Cookies” and include cookies that drive your navigation on our Services).</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">When you first use our Services, we will provide you with a choice as to whether you accept placement of other types of cookies that collect personal information.

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Do-Not-Track Signals</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Because the do-not track signal does not often reflect the preference of our consumers, our website does not respond to it.

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Children’s Access</p>

You may also opt-out by sending an e-mail to privacy@tryinteract.com that contains the email address or phone number you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional communications for. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>

        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If you are located in the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, and have a direct relationship with Interact, you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data by Interact, and this section of our Privacy Policy applies to you.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We have included a couple of additional definitions that apply to individuals in the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland:</p>
        <ul class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Data Controller.</span> A “controller” is the legal entity which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information. Interact is the data controller for all data described by this policy with the following exception: Information collected when individuals participate in a quiz, poll, or promotion offered in connection with our Service is controlled by the Client that created the poll, quiz, or promotion.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Data Processor.</span> A “processor” is a legal entity or other body which processes information collected from Respondents on behalf of the controller, as defined above. Interact is a data processor for information collected at the direction of Interact Clients using our Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Transfer of Information from the EU, UK, or Switzerland</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">When we transfer personal data from the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom or Switzerland to the United States, we do so consistent with the principles of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (collectively “Privacy Shield Principles”), as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data. Interact has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the rights consistent with Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" class="color-pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Interact is subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Consistent with the Privacy Shield Frameworks we inform EU and Swiss individuals that we may be required to release their information in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If Interact shares personal data transferred to the United States consistent with the Privacy Shield Principles with a third-party service provider processing such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing that violates the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event resulting or otherwise giving rise to such violation.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Please note that Interact does not sell, rent or use personal data for reasons other than that for which it was originally collected. If any of those practices should change in the future, we will update this policy appropriately and provide individuals with opt-out or opt-in choice prior to the change being effective.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Consistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, Interact commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield Principles. EU and Swiss individuals with privacy inquiries or complaints should first contact Interact using the information in the <a href="#contact-us" class="color-pink">Contact Us</a> section below.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Interact has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Frameworks to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers" class="color-pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers</a> for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms. See Privacy Shield Annex 1 at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction" class="color-pink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction</a>.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Legal Basis for Processing</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">When we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:</p>
        <ul class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">
          <li>To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing payments for and providing the services you have ordered).</li>
          <li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to operate our business correctly and efficiently or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain and improve our services, conduct data analytics, and communicate with you).</li>
          <li>When we find such processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents and track those who have opted-out of marketing communications).</li>
          <li>When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you agree to receive marketing communications from us).  When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any time by emailing us at privacy@tryinteract.com.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Data Retention</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We will retain your personal information while you have a relationship with Interact, which may include (but is not limited to): registering for an account, subscribing to an Interact newsletter or otherwise having opted in to receiving marketing communications from us (without thereafter having unsubscribed or opted out); logging in to our Service; ordering a product from us; or creating, editing, or otherwise leaving active a Quiz on our Service.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">We maintain personal data for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. You may request that we delete your personal data at any time by emailing us at privacy@tryinteract.com. Except as required under applicable law, your request will be honored within 30 days of receipt.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">In addition, Clients have the ability via the Service to delete Respondent Information for any specific Respondent at any time, using controls available in our Service.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">Notwithstanding the above, Interact will retain your information indefinitely if it believes in good faith that it has a legal obligation to do so.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Data Subject Requests</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">You have the right to request access to the personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred.  You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing.  If you would like to exercise any of these rights, see instructions below.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">With respect to our Clients and individuals with whom we have a direct business relationship, individuals wishing to exercise these rights can (1) email privacy@tryinteract.com or, (2) if you have an account, login to their Interact account by visiting <a href="https://dashboard.tryinteract.com/login" class="color-pink">https://dashboard.tryinteract.com/login</a> and navigate to “Download Personal Data” located under “Account Settings” section of the user dashboard.  If you are a Respondent and Interact processes your personal data on behalf of an Interact Client, please refer your request to our Client to handle. We provide Clients with a "Portability" function, which allows Clients to download all Respondent Information, including personal data, specific to that Client’s Quizzes.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If you would like to remove your name and address from promotional lists (including any personal information gathered by our service providers) and place your name on our “do not contact” list, contact us at privacy@tryinteract.com and request that you be placed on our “do not contact” list. Please note that because names may be similar, you must include in your request all associated email addresses and phone numbers (if any) that you wish to be removed in the body of the email. We reserve the right to contact you for administrative purposes to request more information in order to assist us in deleting your account or information about you. For instance, if you send us an email using an email address that is not in our system, we may contact you to ask you for the email you used when you created your account. We may also send you a confirmation email, once we have deleted your information. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete your information within 30 days from our active files, provided, however, that we may retain—for legal compliance purposes only—your request and associated email in a hashed format so that we do not inadvertently restore your information to our database. Please note that requests to update your personal information may take up to five days. You may also request that we stop processing your information without deleting it, and we will comply within five days of receipt of such a request.</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue font-style-campaign">Questions or Complaints</p>
        <p class="heading-sm color-blue" style="font-size: 1rem;">If you have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you reside.
