And every month, like clockwork, it would arrive in our mailbox.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would rush to my room, flip it open, and immediately take the quiz.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who was my celebrity crush? Which teenage star was destined to be my BFF? Whose fashion sense did I have?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It didn\u2019t matter what the quiz was about or what it actually told me, I just loved the quizzes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I got older, my tastes changed, but my love for quizzes didn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just moved online to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/quizzes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Buzzfeed quizzes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\u2019m not the only one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are making, taking, and sharing Buzzfeed style quizzes like never before. The popularity of social media and the ability to share your favorite quizzes and results with your friends has made it possible for a seemingly simple quiz to be seen and taken by millions of people, all over the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more incredible is businesses can use this exact approach to grow their reach and their bottomline. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/\">Interact<\/a> clients have been at this for a while, and they\u2019ve gotten <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/customers\/\">some amazing results<\/a>! With all of the leads, clients, and sales gotten through quizzes, it\u2019s easy to see that they work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/sell-online-courses-how-kaye-putnam-generated-100k-revenue-from-her-quiz\/\">How Kaye Putnam generated $100K from a quiz<\/a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/quiz-funnel-interview-with-chanti-zak\/\">Chanti Zak made $50,000 with a quiz<\/a><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/elizabeth-mccravy-personality-quiz\/\">How Elizabeth McCravy generated $65K with a quiz<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, today I\u2019m sharing what a Buzzfeed style quiz is, how to make one, and how you can use that quiz to grow your business!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s a Buzzfeed style quiz?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into how to make a Buzzfeed style quiz, let\u2019s discuss what one is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Buzzfeed quiz is built on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Buzzfeed<\/a> platform, but you can build a Buzzfeed <strong>style<\/strong> quiz on other platforms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/\">Interact Quiz Builder<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its heart, a Buzzfeed quiz is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-personality-quiz-for-business-results\/\">personality quiz<\/a>. For a personality quiz, the answer choices for the questions connect with one of the results. These results are personality categories that fit with the topic of the quiz. The quiz result shows whichever personality category shows up the most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These quizzes answer questions like \u201cWhat type of _______ are you?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s your _______ superpower?\u201d Or even \u201cWhat ________ do you fit best with?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the results reveal something about you and your personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a Buzzfeed style quiz is more than a personality quiz.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a specific feel to the quiz that increases its Buzzfeediness! (That\u2019s a word, right??)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buzzfeed quizzes are fun<\/strong>. They\u2019re often about pop culture topics like celebrities, movies, music, books, TV shows, or events that people are interested in. They use language and images that add to the fun vibe. The quizzes are quick and easy, so they\u2019re the perfect way to kill a few minutes. Sometimes, the quiz feels so silly that you just have to take it to try to figure out how they make the connection!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buzzfeed quizzes are positive. <\/strong>The results that you get in a Buzzfeed style quiz are written in a way that feels positive. They aren\u2019t going to criticize you. They\u2019re not going to make you face horrible truths about yourself. The results are as fun and fluffy as the quiz itself. They\u2019re most likely going to be results that you\u2019re happy to get and happy to share.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buzzfeed quizzes are shareable<\/strong>. Because they\u2019re fun, related to pop culture, and offer positive results, Buzzfeed style quizzes are very likely to be shared on social media. People are more likely to share things they enjoy, and you usually can\u2019t scroll through your Facebook or Twitter feed without seeing a few quizzes that your friends have taken.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, then you want to take the quiz to see what results you get.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why people love Buzzfeed quizzes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019re clear on what gives a Buzzfeed quiz its distinct style, it\u2019s important to discuss why people love them!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quizzes tell people about themselves<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>People like to learn about themselves. Buzzfeed quizzes let people view themselves in a different way. They might discover something about themselves they didn\u2019t know before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They might get confirmation for something they suspected, but they weren\u2019t really sure if it was true or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/10-things-you-can-learn-from-buzzfeed-quizzes\/\">10 Things You Can Learn from Buzzfeed Quizzes<\/a>, Josh points out that the Buzzfeed style quiz is all about \u201cyou.\u201d The titles include the word \u201cyou,\u201d the questions are all about you, and the results are about you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/SpHl4YC1NzeVH2lMVUkXyrGSMtO0hKC_QRPu4TYYixu8zdxkcMFGOc36a-YyYCrbMyJtTE6miLdtzMJmbcQEECERyEjOOpFt7EjzD8JNCeeDO7jYcq6n9VqsJOht31nu21wQvh9k\" alt=\"Buzzfeed quiz titles\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the Buzzfeed quiz examples above, you can see that he\u2019s right!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post on Buffer about <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/resources\/the-most-popular-words-in-most-viral-headlines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">the elements of a viral headline<\/a>, they discuss how the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d are the 5th and 13th most common words found in viral headlines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about a quiz title as a headline and the fact that it\u2019s common for Buzzfeed style quizzes, it makes perfect sense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s even more evidence in <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/what-makes-you-click-on-a-headline-70364\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">this study out of Norway<\/a> that found that headlines with the highest number of clicks were questions that referenced the reader with the word you. <br><br>Now go back and look at the Buzzfeed quizzes above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice anything?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/qVjY6W3_ws4zCQfxEikO8FYKlyjFllQbTwtO1IrZzVeA3LSWKFLzYOm6QbO2vlGYg8y9jXDrqRcn9OubR72ofNtCXicEH0MOBBvdh-jjTOMHMw24FSjK1caY5v4OSULASK2HezHh\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Of all of the quizzes from the Buzzfeed screenshot above, only two of them are not questions with \u201cyou\u201d in them!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to see how quiz titles end up going viral.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the Buzzfeed style quiz gives people the opportunity to share the information they learn about themselves with other people. Once they take the quiz, they can click that share button and tell everyone the results they got.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like all aspects of social media, you can filter what result we share with others. You can even retake the quiz until you get results that you like and want to share with others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe that\u2019s just me??<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Buzzfeed quizzes help people feel connected<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be difficult to find the place where we belong in the world. People feel isolated or wonder who they are and where they fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buzzfeed style quizzes can help people find out how they\u2019re connected to other people, places, ideas, etc. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/slate.com\/human-interest\/2014\/01\/buzzfeed-quizzes-taking-over-facebook-feeds-what-makes-them-so-shareable.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">post on Slate about why people share quizzes on Facebook<\/a>, the author states that quizzes \u201cprovide us with the instant affirmation that we share some part of ourselves with other people.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They provide the reassurance that we fit into the categories of the quiz and we have the positive qualities that the Buzzfeed style quizzes identify.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, even more importantly, there are others out there that have those qualities, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know it makes me feel like I belong when I take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/savibm\/create-a-full-face-all-makeup-and-we-will-reveal-w-4gk174cqod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">a quiz<\/a> that tells me that my make-up style shows that I\u2019m like Mulan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\u2019s a strong, independent character, and it shows that my approach to make-up was somewhere on the list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I fit in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>They\u2019re fun<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I stated above that the Buzzfeed style quiz is fun, but it really is one of the top reasons people love them. They like that the quiz provides a momentary distraction. People enjoy how they can explore different parts of pop culture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there are usually lots of images and GIFs, which make the quizzes even more appealing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/buzzfeed-quiz-how-do-they-work_n_4810992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">interview about Buzzfeed quizzes<\/a> for Huffington Post, Summer Anne Burton, a former Managing Editorial Director for Buzzfeed, explains that Buzzfeed style quizzes are a game. People like to see what results they get and share them with others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She compares this style of quiz to astrology because they\u2019re not based on scientific method and they don\u2019t necessarily tell you much about yourself, but they\u2019re entertaining.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019re fun to take, they give an interesting bit of information about you, and the shareability of the results means you can find out the same information about your friends and family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/plans\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Make-Your-own-Quiz-17.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11920\" width=\"452\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Make-Your-own-Quiz-17.png 904w, https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Make-Your-own-Quiz-17-300x53.png 300w, https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Make-Your-own-Quiz-17-768x136.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How quizzes help businesses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to see why Buzzfeed quizzes appeal to the people who take the quizzes, but it\u2019s not clear why or how quizzes help businesses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are actually a few ways that this style of quiz can benefit the business that creates and shares it. Here are a few:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Quizzes generate leads;<\/li><li>Quizzes drive traffic;<\/li><li>Quizzes get shared;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss each of these in more detail to truly understand the benefits they can have for businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quizzes generate leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re familiar with Interact, you know that we believe strongly in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/lead-generating-quiz-advice-from-experts\/\">the power of a quiz to attract people to businesses and convert them into paying customers<\/a>. It\u2019s the entire purpose behind what we do!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process generally goes like this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A customer creates a quiz on <a href=\"https:\/\/dashboard.tryinteract.com\/register\">Interact<\/a> that would interest their ideal customer. The ideal customer takes the quiz and enters their email to get the results. That email address gets added to our customer\u2019s mailing list. Automations created through our customer\u2019s email marketing platform nurture the ideal customer to book a call, buy a product, sign up for a course, or purchase a service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buzzfeed style quizzes are a great way to get people to sign up for your list. Interact clients have been very successful at generating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/customers\/\">thousands of leads<\/a> with their quizzes. The quizzes have a high conversion rate for subscribing to the email list and they often see a ridiculously low ad spend per conversion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one important thing to keep in mind when creating Buzzfeed style quizzes for generating leads.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This style of quiz is not going to generate money for you directly. People won\u2019t pay you money just for giving them a quiz result.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quizzes usually work well at the top of a sales funnel (TOF). Quite often, they\u2019re taken by people who aren\u2019t familiar with your company and your product. That means they won\u2019t just give you money right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to work to nurture that relationship to get them to know you and trust you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through automated email sequences, interactions on social media, and information that you provide them through your website and\/or calls, you have the opportunity to show your value AND get them to hire you or buy from you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Buzzfeed style quiz can be an excellent first step in gaining new clients or customers for your business!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quizzes drive traffic<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone goes to your website to take a quiz, they\u2019re voluntarily visiting your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means there\u2019s the potential for them to visit other parts of your website.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josh, who is the co-Founder of Interact, does a great job of explaining how Buzzfeed does exactly that in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/social-media\/makes-buzzfeed-quizzes-popular-01335537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">a post on what makes Buzzfeed so popular<\/a> for Business 2 Community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains how you go to Buzzfeed to take a quiz and then see other content displayed on the page, so you click those links. You might find lists you want to read or celebrity gossip you can\u2019t live without. While \u201cyou originally took a quiz for fun, &#8230; now you\u2019re sifting through BuzzFeed\u2019s site for other random tidbits of social information.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a business owner, you can be even more specific in what content you want your quiz-takers to view.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/quiz-result-landing-pages\/\">your results page<\/a>, you can share resources that are specific to the quiz results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/chantizak.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Chanti Zak<\/a> does this in her quiz results, where she lists blog posts people can read to help them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/jMtLvGjfcc2xBIv09bKj7FZuZmUjY3Ujj04rdyPgbFftrDBGGoYctt8CcPsp6iT0hY805EJVH_AxJuSOiKp5GyFwcwlNnfozVlnMZaSFnbx9vdDSVMNwywz5acg7KqouLY8s7u4n\" alt=\"quiz result recommended blog content\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jennakutcher.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Jenna Kutcher<\/a> includes a list of her podcast episodes that can help the quiz-takers out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/TLBOU1QXyevq_n1SOGb8M167App91_-yodAnQhl9lvraGw0tcc7XX0pSZB8ml_nOqN1lRpF_sEmbwYtHmK8qcC0KD6DsihWsCW_qF9aTj64xKevd6bS4xKC26Vwgeb0-Ljs2lLn-\" alt=\"Goal Digger podcast list for Empire Maker quiz result\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>A quiz is a great way to drive traffic to specific content on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note about traffic to your website &#8211; If you add your quiz to your website on a traditional landing page and don\u2019t include content that you want your quiz-taker to view, you\u2019ll miss out on this extra traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of a landing page is to focus on the one action that you want the viewer to take.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the action is taking the quiz. Because a landing page does not have a menu or a footer with links to other parts of your website, there\u2019s no way for the quiz-taker to get to your content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s a great idea to then include specific links in your results page for your visitors!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quizzes get shared<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A final way that a Buzzfeed style quiz in particular can help a business is it gets shared on social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, someone takes your quiz and gets their results. They like the results, and they decide to share them on social media.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their friends see the results as they\u2019re scrolling through their Facebook feed and are intrigued. They click through the link, take the quiz, and subscribe to your list to get their results.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After they\u2019re finished, the second contact shares the quiz results with their followers on Twitter and even more people see the results from your quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the process can repeat itself over and over.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a great way to get tons of new subscribers for your email list!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word of caution &#8211; not every person who sees and takes your quiz through organic sharing is going to be your target audience, especially with a Buzzfeed style quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these quizzes are more \u201cfun\u201d than deep, meaty content,you might end up with people on your list that don\u2019t really fit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to practice good list hygiene and try to re-engage or unsubscribe people who aren\u2019t interested in your products or services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if your quiz gets seen by the right people on social media, you could end up with subscribers who you had no connection with before.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quizzes that get shared and convert on social media are worth the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/plans\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Start-Collecting-Leads-8.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11921\" width=\"452\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Start-Collecting-Leads-8.png 904w, https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Start-Collecting-Leads-8-300x53.png 300w, https:\/\/tryinteract-blog.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Start-Collecting-Leads-8-768x136.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to make a Buzzfeed style quiz<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you\u2019re convinced that the Buzzfeed quiz is worth the effort, I\u2019m actually going to take you step-by-step how to make one!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The steps we\u2019re working through include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Planning your quiz;<\/li><li>Creating your results;<\/li><li>Adding your questions;<\/li><li>Mapping your answers;<\/li><li>Styling the quiz;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And, since I\u2019m writing the post, I\u2019m going to create a Buzzfeed style quiz that\u2019ll fit with my business.

And, since this is a Buzzfeed style quiz, what aspect of pop culture or fun would appeal to your people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my quiz will be about email. It might not sound like it\u2019ll be a fun quiz, but I promise it will be!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love a good pop culture quiz, so I think I\u2019ll go with a favorite TV show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where it\u2019s important to consider what audience you want to appeal to. Since TV shows fit with different age groups, I want to choose a show or genre that my target audience would fit with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I wanted to appeal to the baby boomers, I might use classic TV shows like \u201cLeave It to Beaver\u201d or \u201cMASH.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Generation X, it might be something like sit-coms for the 1980s and 90s, like \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFriends.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And millennials might resonate with \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I\u2019m trying to appeal to an audience who has a small business, I\u2019m going with \u201cFriends\u201d for my TV show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it\u2019s my favorite!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/UVlIT-fJRKoXzjhtJgqsSSRbNLBDr5TGeFDxqwIl5xKrTTM1nJ23hQEq4453VJJJ36SPOOpl9JSPkJENXtmcuN-RtKoVKHlE9l3D19oXqQpk2MG2dAfOtxIWOgrR74ZTx2KQGFzu\" alt=\"Friends GIF\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I decide the topic and my TV show, it\u2019s time to figure out what my Buzzfeed style quiz is going to show the quiz-taker about email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For \u201cFriends,\u201d I\u2019m sticking with the results of the six main characters for \u201cFriends\u201d: Joey, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But an excellent Buzzfeed quiz needs to be a little unique and unpredictable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make my quiz stand out, it\u2019s going to help the quiz-taker figure out which \u201cFriends\u201d character they email like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a general plan on what my quiz is about, I can head to Interact and start building it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start building your quiz, Interact gives you two choices on how to begin. You can use a template or start from scratch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/iZikkhSAk25iZnX7dBiEtcEkINpPhu7F1uwVOX3k_bqI8YT9UPCwScpvvHbxOO-1yN4FOO0NEVrHxvCPrb8KVRm76tNhWMjrkaPGyd86xt5ddUt9uCZysBYCCcj6XsEzjAhhwc_Z\" alt=\"quiz template or from scratch quiz\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I normally choose a template. The templates from Interact are divided into categories like Blogging, Business, Entertainment, Animals, Parents, Social Media, Food and Drink, Lifestyle, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each category, there are several different templates to choose from. These templates come with titles, images, questions, and results that you can use or modify as much as you want. It makes it fast and easy to make whatever quiz you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a Buzzfeed style quiz, I would probably choose a template from Entertainment, Animals, or Lifestyle. These have the most flexibility and the widest range of topics to choose from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template quizzes are personality quizzes by default, so you can begin building your quiz right away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I decided to build a quiz from scratch, so I have to choose the type of quiz I want before moving on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/_DYcAEvkXrBxerf-fCdr24x-cPiChkSF9kepMdtmRjt7LDSi-5xe8WdGALa8RMGGT6Jey69zFB7z5znYCpinNuzwCghcuzPi99Tr8pejH2JVsbvDpsWJ5pr94gO1rkHp09Phtsj9\" alt=\"quiz type choices\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>With Interact, you have a choice of an assessment quiz (including identifying right and wrong answers as people are taking the quiz), a personality quiz with its categories, or a scored quiz where each answer is worth a certain number of points and the quiz-taker gets a specific result based on the number of points they earn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a Buzzfeed quiz, I choose personality and go to the blank quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/9h-fm5vRCaf1r-T2HG3snMynp5kGkClbrOd5BV0y8-t2Fpp1M02TMa2NRpaWwoEPcuT8uMvz0AUPk6VyvRKW-qHAQWrWdiVP6ktImfVkMZ2qOxZ6LRCS1ehc17w9P7kO9JfRnzr9\" alt=\"blank quiz cover for Interact quiz\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I mean blank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing on the cover, no results, no questions, no images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to deal with the quiz cover later in the quiz-building process, so I\u2019m ready to create my quiz results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Creating your quiz results<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re building a quiz, it\u2019s always a good idea to figure out your quiz results before you move on to the questions and answer choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should always know where you\u2019re going before you figure out how to get there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll need to create a result for each character in Friends and tie it to email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the connection between these two things, I need to think about what I know about each of the characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Monica is interested in cooking, likes things neat, and loves Chandler.&nbsp;Chandler likes a good joke and might be looking for a new job opportunity. Phoebe is creative and a little bit odd and Rachel is into fashion and celebrities. Joey loves food, women, and dirty jokes, while Ross is into learning, teaching, and dinosaurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I have to think about how those interests would translate into email habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On your quiz result page, you can add a description (which makes the quiz result interesting and useful) and an image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my Phoebe quiz result, I might create a results page like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/ykach8ZQg-DJFcJA6MCUWQ9y5VQoASV62iWOXdflTw1eZ3kTNPiO1UREO6JO_f9-J_6uwhgy2noQPgRVnbxuIdylbd_2x9_9v2axSqM_wuNv3OFKnXa-EmpfwUMsAI2Qdonn1jvy\" alt=\"Email like Phoebe quiz results\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Phoebe result, you can see how I incorporate things about Phoebe\u2019s character and relate it to email practices. It gives a brief description and has a positive spin on characteristics that might not be considered positive (inconsistency).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish the quiz results, I repeat the same process for each of the other characters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>You email like Ross<\/strong> &#8211; Your emails are chalk full of information on areas where you\u2019re an expert.

Getting an email from you is like getting an email from a BFF.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re building a quiz in Interact, you do have the option to add a Call to Action (CTA) button at the bottom.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I usually recommend including a CTA like \u201cBook a Call\u201d or \u201cRead the Blog\u201d or \u201cFollow on ______\u201d with a link to the appropriate URL, I don\u2019t use one for this quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this exact reason, Interact gives you the option to hide the CTA button.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can always include a CTA in your follow-up nurture sequence, which can be even more effective than the one on the results page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the results are added, it\u2019s time to move on to the questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adding your questions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding questions to your quiz, it\u2019s important to remember quiz best practices. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tryinteract.com\/blog\/launch-your-first-quiz\/\">How to Launch Your First Quiz<\/a>, Kayla recommends adding 7-10 questions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since a Buzzfeed style quiz doesn\u2019t need to be quite as deep as other quizzes might need to be, I\u2019m going to have 6 questions in my \u201cFriends\u201d quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to create questions that will help me see how the quiz-takers interests pair up with the \u201cFriends\u201d characters\u2019 interests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And each question will have 6 answer choices, one for each character result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my 6 questions are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>When you open your email, which of these will you read first?<\/li><li>What\u2019s your must-read before you go to bed at night?<\/li><li>What are your plans for next Saturday night?<\/li><li>In your circle of friends, which one are you?<\/li><li>Which email are you most likely to forward on to your friends.?<\/li><li>Which \u201cFriends\u201d GIF or meme is your favorite?<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that 5 of the questions tie directly to the topic of the quiz, and it\u2019ll be easy to see which answer choice goes to which result.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last question is just for fun!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add my questions into Interact, I scroll to the Questions section in the menu at the left, and I end up with a blank question.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/oy4x5zcWMgjK3lujmEGUXs0yl59CBaoup23WIPhYVPnCup_iz7fpMJDyZltLE5UBJwKVU_swHAXBxfagrYoNFfG01kv7-n6PvdTvhjTfome-iGmdsF6yDvbhXBmNMZtmP6dXrmOn\" alt=\"Blank Interact question\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, if you use a template, you won\u2019t have the blank questions.

Staying true to the \u201cFriends\u201d theme, I chose the bright primary red for the button and a light blue for the backgrounds of the answer choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also wanted an informal font that feels as close to the \u201cFriends\u201d font as I could find.

If it doesn&#8217;t match with the tone of your brand, the purpose of the quiz, or you need highly qualified leads, you might want to make a different type of quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brand tone<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your brand has a more professional tone, you need to consider whether a BuzzFeed quiz is the best option. Because it has such a fun vibe and an informal topic, it might be out of character to use this style of quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people get your follow-up email sequence, if it doesn&#8217;t have a similar tone to the one in the quiz, they&#8217;ll quickly lose interest and unsubscribe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more serious brand, another type of quiz might be more effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quiz purpose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re in a situation where the quiz results are important and will be used for another purpose, a Buzzfeed style quiz might not be the best choice. These results are more for fun and don&#8217;t have any sort of scientific validity in how they&#8217;re created.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With my background in education, I know it wouldn\u2019t work to use a Buzzfeed quiz to have my students show that they\u2019ve mastered the necessary information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you need reliable results for evaluation or marketing purposes, there are other quizzes that do this much more effectively than a Buzzfeed style quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Qualifying Leads<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As I stated earlier in the quiz, Buzzfeed style quizzes work great at the top of the funnel. They work well to get people to subscribe to your list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the people who subscribe won\u2019t necessarily know you or your products and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They most likely won\u2019t be the people who are ready to purchase your $5K coaching package (or any other high-ticket items).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can potentially nurture them towards the sale through follow-up emails and phone calls, it\u2019s usually not a quick turn-around. It\u2019s more of a long-term investment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, other types of quizzes could perform better for you in identifying and converting people for your high-ticket item than a Buzzfeed quiz.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they\u2019re not the right quiz choice for every situation, there\u2019s no denying the appeal and success of a Buzzfeed style quiz!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buzzfeed style quizzes for the win<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You now know everything you need to know to create your own Buzzfeed style quiz. With the right combination of fun and marketing appeal, you\u2019ll create a quiz that people will love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\u2019t wait to see what you come up with!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Interested in creating a Buzzfeed style quiz?
