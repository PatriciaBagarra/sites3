<p>A big challenge for marketing leaders is knowing when to invest in certain activities, and when to conserve valuable budget dollars. When it comes to digital advertising on Google’s display network, it’s easy to burn through cash quickly without any return. So when should you use responsive display ads?&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are responsive display advertisements (RDAs)?</h2>



<p>First, responsive display ads (RDAs for short) are automatically created in Google Ads based on content you provide—images, videos, headline and description text. Then, Google tests various combinations of these inputs through machine learning to find what performs the best.</p>



<h2>What is the difference between traditional and responsive ads?</h2>



<p><a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6363750?hl=en">According to Google</a>, responsive display ads are replacing traditional ads as the default ad type for the Display Network. Aside from optimizing ad performance, this allows Google to fill as much inventory on the Display Network as possible.&nbsp;The main difference is RDAs aren&#8217;t as manual and time-consuming as traditional ads.</p>



<h2>When should businesses use RDAs?</h2>



<p>Responsive display ads can be used at every stage of the marketing funnel. They can be used to reach interest-based audiences to help aid prospecting efforts. Or, they can be used to remarket previous visitors and draw them back to your site to complete the conversion cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few scenarios where it may be a good time to use RDAs:</p>



<ol><li>You’re already running standard image or HTML5 ads, but want to test new ad types and measure impact on performance. Earlier this year, we tested performance between traditional and responsive ads. We found responsive ads significantly outperformed traditional ads. Listen to the podcast below to hear more specifics about the test.</li><li>You don’t have the design resources to create standard image ads. One major benefit of responsive display ads is they require no design skills. Supply the images and text and Google does the rest.</li><li>You’re not seeing great performance with standard display ads. We often see that RDAs outperform traditional display ads. This isn’t always the case. However, more often than not, RDAs do yield stronger results due to the flexibility and broader inventory that they can fit.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: When should companies use responsive display ads?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2Mn5YMeFGvekgPbG5gXUSU?si=diejpHA3Tci5HrC2l-FaRA&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>What content do you need for RDA campaigns?</h2>



<p>Traditional display ads came in a variety of sizes. Sizing images to meet Google’s specifications was time consuming for advertisers. Below is an example of various ad sizes and formats that previously needed to be uploaded manually. Responsive display ads automate this manual process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="783" height="496" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RDA-Blog-Graphics.jpg" alt="An example of various ad sizes and formats on the Google Display Network" class="wp-image-2150" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RDA-Blog-Graphics.jpg 783w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RDA-Blog-Graphics-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RDA-Blog-Graphics-768x486.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /></figure>



<p>Imagery is a critical part of responsive display ads. Plain images work best, with minimal or no text overlay. Companies can also upload their logos. And for companies with strict brand guidelines, there’s an option to specify a main and accent color that will get incorporated into the designs.</p>



<p>Google allows up to 5 headlines and 5 descriptions, with 1 additional “longer description” field. Here are the copy fields Google requires for responsive display ads:</p>



<ul><li>A short headline (25 characters)</li><li>A long headline (90 characters)</li><li>A description (90 characters)</li><li>Your business name (25 characters)</li></ul>



<h2>What kind of reporting is possible with RDAs?</h2>



<p>With responsive display ads, you can report on asset-level performance. This means that you can see which combinations of images and text perform best. This is really valuable as a marketer because these reports can be analyzed to find underperforming assets and replace them to drive stronger performance.</p>



<h2>How can companies get started with responsive display ads?</h2>



<p>While Google makes it easy to set up a campaign, it can be a lot to manage for in-house marketing teams. Especially considering Google’s plan to phase out third-party cookies by 2023, which will impact targeting options. Instead of relying as heavily on re-marketing and cookie-based audiences, marketers should focus on building and scaling a <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/what-is-first-party-data-how-can-marketers-use-it/">first-party data</a> strategy to fuel lookalike audiences.</p>

<p>On April 26, 2021 Apple released an update to the recent iOS 14 software, iOS 14.5, which put an emphasis on user privacy through their App Tracking Transparency feature. Companies running Facebook Ad campaigns saw an impact on performance as users were opted-<em>out </em>by default. Instead, they now have the option to opt-<em>in </em>to receiving ads.</p>



<p>This update has been in place for some time now, giving us enough data to see the impact on Facebook Ad campaigns across our client portfolio. These insights can help marketers address this change and evolve their digital marketing strategy.</p>



<h2>How Many Users Have App Tracking Transparency?</h2>



<p>When we looked at data available to us across high-volume accounts, we saw 16.6% adoption of iOS 14.5 in the first 10 days after being released (April 26th &#8211; May 6th). The chart below shows how this compares to adoption rates of other iOS updates in the past.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="726" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-1024x726.png" alt="worldwide adoption rate of iOS 14.5 in the first 10 days compared to other major iOS updates in the past" class="wp-image-1935" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-1024x726.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-300x213.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-768x544.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-1536x1089.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/chart-01-2048x1451.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As of July 2021, more than 64% of iOS mobile and tablet devices were operating on iOS 14.6, according to <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide">Statcounter Global Stats</a>. This means a majority of iOS devices include the App Tracking Transparency feature.</p>



<div id="mobile+tablet-ios_version-ww-monthly-202007-202107" width="600" height="400" style="width:600px; height: 400px;"></div><!-- You may change the values of width and height above to resize the chart --><p>Source: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide">StatCounter Global Stats &#8211; iOS Version Market Share</a></p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.statcounter.com/js/fusioncharts.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?mobile+tablet-ios_version-ww-monthly-202007-202107&#038;chartWidth=600"></script>



<p>Another key metric to monitor is the number of users who opt-in to having their personal data shared with advertisers. According to <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-idfa-app-tracking-transparency-weekly/">Flurry Analytics</a>, 15% of iOS 14.5 users in the United States opted<em>-in</em> to ad tracking four months after the software was released—noticeably lower than the 21% of users who have opted-in worldwide.</p>



<h2>Early Impact of Apple’s iOS 14.5 Update on Facebook Ads</h2>



<p>Apple’s App Tracking Transparency program was a major foray into a privacy-centric marketing environment. We have only just begun to understand its impact. But one thing is clear: marketers will need to adjust their strategies and campaigns to keep up with this evolving marketplace.</p>



<p>When we looked at Facebook campaign performance data across high-volume accounts in 2021, we were able to dig deep into the impact of iOS 14.5 on Facebook Ad campaigns. Here are a few key findings:</p>



<h3>Decline in Ad Impressions Makes Reaching Audiences More Expensive</h3>



<p>More users opting out of tracking means target audiences are harder to reach, which increases acquisition costs. Total ad impressions on Facebook declined by nearly 19% from Q1 to Q2, 2021. With shrinking audience sizes, marketers will need to consolidate campaigns on the platform.</p>



<p>Smaller audience sizes have resulted in higher demand to reach target buyers. Companies were willing to pay a premium on audience impressions in Q2. In our dataset, the cost-per-thousand (CPM) impressions rose by a staggering 67% from Q1 to Q2 (see the monthly breakdown below). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost-1024x480.jpg" alt="average monthly cost-per-thousand (CPM) impressions, 2021 before and after the iOS 14.5 update" class="wp-image-2140" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost-1536x720.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AverageMonthlyCost.jpg 1844w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It will be interesting to monitor what this threshold looks like as more users opt-out of tracking. Will companies ditch Facebook and seek out advertisements on other platforms? Only time will tell.</p>



<h3>Fewer Audience Insights Means Less Control for Marketers</h3>



<p>Ad campaigns on Facebook can vary depending on your strategy and goals. “Conversions” can be anything from a video view, a website page visit, or a purchase. However, despite the nature of these conversions, we noticed Facebook quickly phased out audience insights like website conversions by various demographics.</p>



<p>The week of the iOS 14.5 update, two-thirds of weekly website conversions were grouped into an “unknown” age category. By June, 100% of website conversions through Facebook campaigns were grouped as “unknown.” In just six weeks, this valuable demographic data was stripped away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="422" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age-1024x422.jpg" alt="Weekly facebook ad campaign conversions by age, 2021" class="wp-image-2141" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age-1024x422.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age-768x316.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age-1536x633.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFacebookCampaign_age.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Other demographic data was impacted, too. For instance, monthly website conversions by gender reached 100% unknown by June, 2021. The same goes for geo-location data, too.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="553" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender-1024x553.jpg" alt="Monthly facebook ad campaign conversions by gender, 2021" class="wp-image-2142" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender-768x415.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/WeeklyFBCampaign_gender.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><br>Phasing out reporting abilities by this demographic data is a fairly significant blow to marketers who relied on Facebook for audience insights and targeting. If you want to learn more, my colleague TJ goes in-depth about this on our <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/podcasts/#player-anchor">podcast</a>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: What’s the impact of iOS 14.5 on Facebook Ads?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1zq153S48f0OdPXgqjOb4B?si=qWbCNXBETmSP0uHIArd8Mw&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>How Should Marketing Strategies Evolve After iOS 14.5?</h2>



<p>It was inevitable. Consumers now have more power and control over their data than ever before. Not only can they seek out privacy settings, but now, they’ll be prompted to make a decision before anything is decided for them.</p>



<p>These changes present an opportunity for marketers to out-maneuver competitors. We are accelerating towards a more automated, less transparent experience with advertising platforms. On top of that, marketers will have smaller audience sizes to work with. This means <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/paid-media/how-to-build-a-creative-team-for-paid-media/">creative needs to get better</a>, offers need to be more enticing, and value exchanges need to be seamless.<br><br>All of this depends on how effectively companies can use <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/what-is-first-party-data-how-can-marketers-use-it/">first-party customer data</a> in their marketing strategy. This valuable information, collected directly from customers and prospects themselves, can be used to personalize messages, target geographic locations, and inform machine learning. But it requires a thoughtful and intentional strategy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><a href="/whitepaper/how-to-build-scale-first-party-data-strategy/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Free eBook: How to Build and Scale a First-Party Data Strategy" class="wp-image-2034" width="840" height="420" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></a></figure>



<p>Marketing leaders running campaigns impacted by this change should work with their marketing teams or agencies to understand the deeper impacts of smaller audiences, limited reporting, and the effectiveness of their advertising content.

<p>There are four main types of search intent: informational, navigational, transactional, and commercial investigation. When users conduct an informational search about a certain geography (e.g. “plumber washington dc”) the search algorithm looks for websites optimized for these local searches. This is why local SEO is important.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is local SEO?</h2>



<p>Local SEO is the practice of making adjustments to your website so it has higher search visibility for keywords with local intent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes searches such as “near me” and “[service] [city]” searches. These queries will pull up a different search engine results page (SERP) layout than a general search. Depending on the industry, Google may serve up local home service ads, regular ads, and a map pack that displays the top three businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is an example of a SERP for the search phrase “plumber washington dc”, which is a highly valuable search with local intent.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PrpqUUNgnnzpCj5z-KThJiUHfNt1De01UE-nOtuKx2wofxiwkRAZurQ3RP1sEHFzPfJi4czg5oWhmvOO8cd5UKNgBjtnxhnB-U2Yx_TlQAkIgjGGbI9kQztPETRJYldpR-7JBX5s" alt="top of the search engine results page for the search query, &quot;plumber washington dc&quot; the results include both the local home services ads and regular paid ads.

<p>At the top of the page are the local home service ads as well as regular paid ads.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XIrzAkLh1xGuG_M8HpWTrnWW9zkzbADaO-yDBI0m8ye7PpOrLZJfmX8Fcf9_R7iCWlsbqQWMPheJLIO6iL3Js1zfkBf2gHPcvxEdMC-iIM277Wj5fodeMtmhAoOVw2PV7lNbOJxK" alt="below the ads on the search engine results page for the search query, &quot;plumber washington dc&quot; is the 3 pack map listing, featuring average ratings and reviews."/></figure>



<p>Below that is the all-important 3 pack map listing. This section is critical because it&#8217;s a 24/7 lead generator, and any leads or clicks are unpaid. This area of the SERP also takes up significant real estate and is a huge driver of traffic on mobile.</p>



<h2>Why is local SEO important to your business?</h2>



<p>If your business has a physical brick-and-mortar location, or if your business services a specific geographic area, you can reap the benefits of optimizing for local search. Some of these categories include; local home service, law firms, hospitality services, restaurants, and medical practices.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Nearly half (<a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/12-local-seo-stats-every-business-owner-and-marketer-should-know-in-2019-i/549079/">46% to be exact</a>) of all searches have local intent.</li><li>The common “near me” searches that trigger map listings have risen 900% in the past two years (source <a href="https://www.chatmeter.com/blog/50-local-seo-stats-every-marketer-should-know-2018/">Chatmeter</a>)</li><li>Local searches result in a purchase 28% of the time (source <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats">hubspot</a>)</li><li>An offline purchase is the result of nearly 78% of local searches on mobile devices( <a href="https://seotribunal.com/blog/stats-to-understand-seo/#local-seo-facts">source</a>)&nbsp;</li><li>Position one on the map pack results in 24% of all clicks (<a href="https://seotribunal.com/blog/stats-to-understand-seo/#local-seo-facts">source</a>)</li></ul>



<h2><br>How do you rank for local searches?</h2>



<h3><strong>Google My Business</strong></h3>



<p>The very first and most critical step is your Google My Business listing. This is the most valuable asset a local business has, second only to your website. You will either need to claim or create your listing and then <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/b2c/how-to-add-and-optimize-your-home-services-gmb-listing/">optimize</a>.</p>



<p>You must make sure that your Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) are consistent across the web with what appears on this listing. This helps build credibility in the eyes of Google as well as the consumer. Listen to the podcast episode below to learn more about how to create a robust Google My Business profile.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: How do you create a robust Google My Business profile?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/6Xwy0xtwrbwVR2vSRE2AaX?si=X1iB8XJWRJqKlwLz8kQSlw&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>Local Links and Citations</strong></h3>



<p>Link building has changed quite a bit, especially in the last few years. For example, you should not submit your website and business info to every directory listing site across the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there is still value to the core listing services such as Yelp, YP, BBB, etc. Having your website as well as the correct NAP information will be a huge help for your business.</p>



<p>While you won&#8217;t want to submit your website to every deep web listing service, you will want to work to generate local backlinks to your website. These are very valuable to Google because they are relevant to your business and local to your area. Some of these include:</p>



<ul><li>Local Chamber of Commerce</li><li>Sponsoring a local event (Look for a sponsor page on the event website)</li><li>Supplier links (Not necessarily local but a strong backlink)</li><li>Church websites</li><li>Local newspapers, and forums</li><li>Local bloggers</li></ul>



<h3><strong>On-Page Optimization</strong></h3>



<p>We have touched on the off-page factors that can boost your rankings for local searches, now let’s take a look at what you can do on your website.</p>



<p>You should have localized content that matches what your searchers are looking for. These pages should have target keywords to help boost up your organic presence as well. Each page should be optimized with an appropriate title, headings, images, meta, alt, etc.</p>



<p>The local NAP used on your website should be consistent with the GMB profile and every other listing as well.</p>



<p>These are some of the most critical local SEO ranking factors for your business. In many cases further and more ongoing work will be necessary due to the competitive nature of the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Keyword Research, Tracking, and Implementation</strong></h3>



<p>Along with on-page optimization, proper keyword research, tracking, and implementation is critical.</p>



<p>Local keyword research must be done to see how your customers are finding your business and services. It is also important to track these keywords and how they change over time.</p>



<p>Below is an example from the same industry and search area as before:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pXuPRYJl2tynZqwMFI6Bvy9WTMWXwJOuV-anfaswOLDqpTsEvgCndUbTriheF4m2cQWzlD7qnsjplLak1LSp4S9BTI7_OoFTfKF6s1OeMoPQtYRCPsMFTxTtHpmtvnX-Vkiy_mWP" alt="3 pack map results for the search query, &quot;emergency plumber washington dc&quot;"/></figure>



<p>We can see that the maps are pulling “emergency plumbing” keywords from the site. This is why a business would want to optimize services keywords for their local area.</p>



<h2>The future of local SEO</h2>



<p>Nobody ever truly knows what the next major update from Google will look like, as well as what the changes in user behavior will entail.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/voice-search-statistics">One-third of the population</a> is now using voice search, which can drastically change search queries and how people make decisions.</p>



<p>This is why it is important that local SEO is not done with a “set it and forget it” mentality. What has ranked you above the competition in the past may not work in the future.</p>



<h2>Get started with local SEO</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the return on investment for local SEO is astronomical. Building credibility with Google early will increase your rankings. But this will take time. Especially if the industry is highly competitive or if your business is just getting started with its online presence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But this investment will be worth it when these keywords start to display your business as one of the top 3 map positions.</p>

<p>Paid media advertisement performance will rely heavily on testing creative, but these tests take time. This is why marketing leaders need to learn how to build a creative team for high-performance campaigns.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2017/when-it-comes-to-advertising-effectiveness-what-is-key/">2017 Nielsen study</a>, creative elements accounted for 47% of ad performance—the largest contributor. This means creative elements may be the single biggest driver of action rates, an amplifier of an ad’s total value (see the illustration below).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/how-to-build-scale-first-party-data-strategy/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="579" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM-1024x579.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2118" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM-1024x579.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM-300x170.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM-768x434.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM-1536x869.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-04-22-at-2.14.08-PM.png 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve established why creative is so important to paid media campaigns, let&#8217;s dive into some of the challenges and solutions in learning how to build creative teams that align with paid media goals.</p>



<h2>Challenges Between Creative and Paid Media Teams</h2>



<p>One challenge is how creative and paid media teams collaborate. Whether both teams are in-house, outsourced to an agency, or some combination, these two teams often runs into three key stumbling blocks:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tight turnarounds.</strong> A sense of urgency to push something out to key audiences can result in cut corners and poor creative. It’s crucial that creative and paid media teams map out campaigns as far in advance as the strategy allows.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Empty toolboxes.</strong> If a creative team doesn’t have the assets or knowledge they need to build the creative suite, some placements or formats can be at-risk. If the paid media team isn’t aware of the creative possibilities, new opportunities could be left on the table. Bottom line: not having the right tools from the start can result in missed opportunities and sub-par performance.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Lack of communication.</strong> It’s essential for both parties to understand the full breadth of the campaign. Do we have a landing page? Is there a video component? How do the static formats maintain a cohesive look with the dynamic pieces? What are the value propositions that must be included in the copy?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: What role does creative play in digital marketing?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/7iAjXmRMyGmgQdHzt4M14b?si=VXpJwdWZSZyWQlIBEynG6Q&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>How to Strengthen Relationships Between Creative and Paid Media Teams</h2>



<p>Effective collaboration between these two teams must start with both parties having a firm understanding of what the other knows and needs in order to be successful. This goes from campaign goals and target audiences to brand guidelines and ad platforms. </p>



<p>Strengthening the relationship between paid media and creative teams has been an ongoing priority at Silverback. Here’s some perspective from leaders within our agency on how to build a creative team that has a strong relationship with paid media:</p>



<h3>1. Connect outside the creative brief. </h3>



<p>“The Paid Team is responsible for getting them a standard amount of information for our Creative Teams to take and run with. This information includes goals like awareness, traffic, leads or sales; platforms; the CTA; brand guidelines; and the desired look and feel, if that’s been specified by the client,” Andrew Fuchs, Director of Paid Media and Analytics says. With that information, a face-to-face (or virtual) meeting allows both parties to ask questions and brainstorm ideas that a Slack or Google Doc doesn’t enable. </p>



<h3>2. Make room for creative iterations. </h3>



<p>This principle works against the tight turnaround curse we mentioned earlier. Making room for creative iterations in the beginning can ultimately save a lot of time for future campaigns. “Whether it’s color, typography, layouts or visual elements, it’s essential that we carry the same aesthetic throughout all visual assets,” says Amy Zepf, Silverback’s Creative Director.  “As designers, we are responsible for defining this standard look and feel based on the brand guidelines. From there, we create an adaptable process so our assets are cohesive. This typically results in a campaign&#8217;s success—based on how the client defines it.”</p>



<h3>3. Make data and insights readily available. </h3>



<p>We are performance marketers through and through. It’s not just about brand alignment or platform best practices. Did the campaign drive the intended result? The Paid team shares these insights with the Creative team so they can digest the results and identify opportunities for improvement, or more learning, in the next campaigns. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/how-to-build-scale-first-party-data-strategy/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2034" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h2>How to Foster Two-Way Communication between Creative and Paid Teams</h2>



<p>Each team brings valuable expertise to the table. And once each party trusts the other, the results are typically innovative campaigns that meet performance goals. Creative teams are able to understand how audiences are formed and other meaningful characteristics. On the other hand, paid media teams are able to understand creative trends on ad platforms so they can maximize their impact.</p>



<p>It’s in these conversations where the collaboration really shines as we discuss campaign learnings, creative iterations, A/B testing opportunities or new platform experimentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s important to have a systematic feedback loop to facilitate these conversations. As you learn how to build a creative team, the size of paid media campaigns will influence how frequent these feedback loops should happen.</p>



<h2>Tools to Help Build Creative Team Alignment with Paid Media</h2>



<p>The intersection of spot-on audience targeting, ads that drive action, creative that stops a person mid-scroll is a territory that paid and creative teams must venture into together. Whether it&#8217;s Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google or YouTube, marketing leaders are offered a <a href="https://create.withgoogle.com/platforms/more-ad-formats/display">window of opportunity </a>that can be missed if they don’t know how to build a creative team the right way and align them with paid media campaigns.</p>



<p>Even ad platforms have built-in tools to foster this creative alignment. <a href="https://create.withgoogle.com/">Create with Google</a> provides more than just placement specs and ad format overviews. The tool answers basic questions and also provides a narrative about creative capabilities and audience connections that can be formed.<br><br>Similarly, <a href="https://business.facebook.com/creatorstudio/">Facebook Creator Studio</a> provides a space for content libraries to come to life. It offers insights related to performance so paid and creative teams can make informed decisions together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Increasing enrollments is a major indicator of performance for colleges and universities. This starts by generating more qualified applicants. But higher education marketers were faced with major disadvantages during the pandemic. For example, recent research on high school students has found that in-person campus visits did not play a significant role in selecting a college or university in 2021. </p>



<p>In fact, only 23% of high school students said they visited a university campus between March 2020 and March 2021. This neutralized the “campus experience” so many colleges and universities have relied on in the past.</p>



<p>So how can colleges and universities drive more enrollments? With a high-performance website and sound digital marketing strategy.</p>



<h2>About the Research</h2>



<p>In March of 2021, Silverback Strategies surveyed 1,071 parents and students in the U.S. Questions focused on their experience searching, finding and evaluating higher education alternatives. The sample includes perspectives from parents, high-school students, and first-year college students who graduated in 2020. This provided a holistic view of these key audience segments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/2021-higher-education-research-the-parent-and-student-journey/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2109" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-higher-ed-BlogCTA.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h2>What role does a university website play in the student journey?</h2>



<p>This research on high school students has found that more than 90% plan to enroll in a college or university. And more than 70% of high school students went online to evaluate alternatives. This means high school students—and their parents—likely use search engines for initial research on colleges and universities.</p>



<p>It’s critical for higher education marketers to have an easy-to-navigate website with the resources parents and students need. Websites need to have the technical components to create a seamless user experience. But they must also be optimized for search through content that appeals to both students and parents. </p>



<h2>What information do high school students find valuable on university websites?</h2>



<p>In this research study, we asked both students and parents which school-provided resources they found most helpful on a university website. Parents placed a slightly higher emphasis on admissions information, course overview, curriculum, and materials. Students were mostly aligned with parents, but found loan and financial information most helpful.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/2021-higher-education-research-the-parent-and-student-journey/"><img loading="lazy" width="738" height="612" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure5-valuable-website-resources.jpg" alt="Research results table showing percentage of students and parents who found each resource most helpful on college or university websites. " class="wp-image-2110" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure5-valuable-website-resources.jpg 738w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure5-valuable-website-resources-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></a></figure>



<p>Higher education marketers have an opportunity to gain search visibility with content about details of courses and programs. These detailed pages would target long-tail searches. Listen to the podcast episode below to hear more about SEO-driven content strategies (2:38).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption>Jacob Clarke shares his perspective about SEO-driven content strategies on the Digital Marketing Troop podcast.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the example shared on the podcast above, about 1,200 people every month search the term &#8220;types of nursing degrees.&#8221; Colleges or universities who offer nursing degrees should create a page about their nursing program that answers that question. It&#8217;s a great way to get in front of parents and students at this point in their buying journey.</p>



<h2>On which social media platforms can higher education marketers reach parents and students?</h2>



<p>This research on high school students has found that social media has become an important channel to reach both students and parents. Higher education providers should consider each group’s preferred media when developing social media strategies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/2021-higher-education-research-the-parent-and-student-journey/"><img loading="lazy" width="743" height="584" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure6-social-media-platforms-used-by-segment.png" alt="Research results table showing percentage of students and parents who actively use each social media platform." class="wp-image-2111" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure6-social-media-platforms-used-by-segment.png 743w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Figure6-social-media-platforms-used-by-segment-300x236.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /></a></figure>



<p>YouTube was the most popular platform used by both college and high school students. More than 80% of these groups reported using YouTube multiple times per week. This channel was also used significantly by parents, with nearly 70% using the platform multiple times per week.</p>



<p>However, there were notable differences in platform usage between parents and students. For instance, students were much more likely to use Snapchat and TikTok. Parents were more likely to be active on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>



<p>This dichotomy presents an opportunity to approach each social media platform somewhat differently. For example, 87.9% of parents use Facebook multiple times per week versus just 27.6% of incoming freshmen. This makes Facebook a channel well-suited to reach parents, but not students. Knowing this, marketers could develop more relevant content for parents on Facebook, like information about curriculum.</p>



<p>Alternatively, parents are mostly inactive on several of the most popular apps for students, like TikTok and Snapchat. On these platforms, content relating to students’ top interests like financial support may resonate more.</p>



<h2>How can higher education marketers leverage first-party data in their digital strategy?</h2>



<p><a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/what-is-first-party-data-how-can-marketers-use-it/">First-party data</a> is information you gather directly from your audience, and can be powerful fuel for digital marketing activities.</p>



<p>It will be important to collect first-party data from engaged prospects and website visitors. Marketers should have a plan for cookie consent management on their websites to maximize first-party data potential, as well as migrating to the new Google Analytics 4 platform to measure site performance under this new privacy-centric model. This is critical infrastructure that should be implemented before third-party cookies and <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/podcast/why-did-google-pause-their-third-party-data-plans/">phased out completely in 2023</a>.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Activating first-party data can help marketers develop personalized and meaningful email nurture campaigns that address each persona’s top priorities. Since the enrollment journey is so long, this kind of email nurture also serves as a periodic reminder of the institution’s value proposition. Staying top of mind for qualified prospects throughout the entire journey will increase applications when that time comes.</p>

<p>80% of readers never make it past your headline. That&#8217;s why every marketer should know how to write SEO headlines that appeal to both people <em>and </em>search algorithms.<br><br>Back in the advertising heyday of the ‘60s, David Ogilvy warned copywriters not to skimp on the headline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“On the average,” he is quoted, “Five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.”</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right —&nbsp;<a href="https://moz.com/blog/5-data-insights-into-the-headlines-readers-click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of readers</a>&nbsp;never even make it past the headline.</p>



<p>Whether you’re blogging for brand awareness or sales, getting your blog post read is the first and most important step.&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/defining-the-value-of-seo-how-do-you-measure-seo-success">Search engine optimization</a>&nbsp;is great way to funnel an attentive audience to your posts, but it’s easy to make the mistake of over-optimizing for search engines and under-optimizing for actual human readers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SEO is only half the battle — clickability and readability are crucial to getting users to move from the search engine results page (SERP) to your website. Clickable blog titles drive more traffic, even from non-search sources (paid, email, social), which in turn, signals to Google that an article is worth reading.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/4vB0fwZG8p1VNcRczaiVjb" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Like most things in marketing, headline writing is one part art, one part science. Here’s how to write SEO headlines that please people as much as they do search engines:</p>



<h2>1. Research possible keywords and variations.</h2>



<p>Effective keyword research is integral to any SEO strategy, and blog headlines are no different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These should be keywords that, if someone typed them in and found your content, your content would answer the need they&#8217;re expressing. You’ll want to research a combination of head terms and long tail keyword phrases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One easy way to guess at potential long-tail keyword phrases is to take your cue from Google. When you search for your head term, what phrases does Google guess? What searches does it suggest you conduct next? These suggestions are based on other users’ behavior and can serve as a good clue for what people might type in.</p>



<p>Another valuable tool for content marketers is Google&#8217;s &#8220;People also ask&#8221; feature. This element of the SERP normally shows up for question queries, suggesting other potential search terms based on users&#8217; behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve written down a list of possible keywords and keyword phrases, you want to identify the ones that are both worth going after (i.e. have a reasonable volume of traffic) and that you have a good chance of ranking for (low competition), which leads us to the next step&#8230;</p>



<h2>2. Narrow down keyword list based on opportunity.</h2>



<p>Look for data on search volume and competition, but also look for other indicators of opportunity.</p>



<p>Does the current SERP have a featured snippet, or is that area up for grabs?</p>



<p>Are there local results?</p>



<p>Are reviews included on the SERP?</p>



<p>If you’re already tracking any keywords in SEMRush or Moz, it&#8217;s also helpful to check in on what you’re already ranking for (after all, there’s no point competing with yourself). If you have it set up,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Search Console</a>&nbsp;can also help identify SEO opportunities.</p>



<p>For more on identifying the right keyword, read&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/choosing-the-perfect-keyword-for-seo">Choosing The Perfect Keyword For SEO</a>.</p>



<h2>3. Write several headline options per post.</h2>



<p>I generally write my post first, letting the keyword drive the&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/8-essential-elements-for-on-page-seo">on-page SEO</a>, and leave headline writing for last. Some choose to decide on a catchy headline first and then write a post to fit it. Whichever option you choose, you&#8217;ll want to give yourself options as you learn how to write SEO headlines.</p>



<p>Ogilvy said his most famous headline took him 104 different drafts to write. I’m not saying you have to write hundreds of options, but the headline is important enough to deserve a chunk of your time.</p>



<p>This honestly comes down to headline writing formulas more often than I care to admit. Google &#8220;headline swipe files&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find some common headline writing formulas that work well. BuzzSumo has written some great articles on which&nbsp;<a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/most-shared-headlines-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headline phrases get the most social shares from B2C</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/write-engaging-b2b-headlines-analysis-10-million-articles-shared-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B2B audiences</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator?__hstc=244329818.e4a96fe168d6a6d974efda32ae5427b6.1595907233258.1605748714280.1605753658992.38&amp;__hssc=244329818.1.1605753658992&amp;__hsfp=3748034336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HubSpot&#8217;s blog topic generator</a>&nbsp;is a favorite for getting the juices flowing. For instance, for the head term “headline writing,” the topic generator spat out this:</p>



<h2>4. Select a headline.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>At this point, you’ve got several good headline options, they all include your target keyword, and it’s time to choose one to launch your content into the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To give myself some parameters for this, I like to use&nbsp;<a href="https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoSchedule&#8217;s Free Headline Analyzer tool</a>. It gives each headline a score based on common headline types, character count, word type balance, etc. It&#8217;s not foolproof, but it&#8217;s useful for learning how to write SEO headlines. Generally, I aim for 75 or higher and throw out anything less than a 60.</p>



<p>What makes a great headline? Since headlines are only as good as your users think they are, the rules are always changing, but here are a few constants.</p>



<p>Great headlines&#8230;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Make people feel something.<br></strong>People engage with content that inspires strong emotions, both positive and negative. Engagement helps your content spread and gives busy readers a reason to stop and pay attention.</li><li><strong>Set the right expectations.<br></strong>Many publishers use “clickbait” headlines to inspire people to click out of curiosity, but in the long run, this tactic can be harmful for rankings and reach. Due to negative user feedback,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654730/facebook-news-feed-update-kill-off-clickbait" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and Google have more or less declared&nbsp;<a href="https://yoast.com/not-write-click-bait-headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">war against clickbait</a>.<a href="https://yoast.com/not-write-click-bait-headlines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;When clickbait brings people to your site,</a>&nbsp;it typically results in high bounce rates — a metric that indicates low quality content to both networks. A better tactic is to be honest with your readers, build trust and set expectations about what they will find when they click through.</li><li><strong>Keep it simple.<br></strong>Use plain language and as few words as possible to get your point across without losing people’s attention or getting cut off by mobile views.</li><li><strong>Follow proven headline writing formulas.<br></strong>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Of course you want to put your own spin on anything you write (and never, ever plagiarize), but great headline writers rarely start completely from scratch.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-blog-headlines?__hstc=244329818.e4a96fe168d6a6d974efda32ae5427b6.1595907233258.1605748714280.1605753658992.38&amp;__hssc=244329818.1.1605753658992&amp;__hsfp=3748034336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are 13 blog headline examples</a>&nbsp;to get you started.</li></ul>



<h2>How to Write SEO Headlines for Readers and Rankings</h2>



<p>Whatever you do, don’t let your headlines be an afterthought. In today’s content-soaked world, readers have a million options (and just as many distractions). Your headline has to give them a reason to choose your article over every other option, whether those options appear on a SERP or on their Facebook Feed. Different&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/5-powerful-reasons-to-integrate-your-seo-ppc-social-strategies">digital marketing tactics no longer exist in silos</a>, so your headline has to work harder than ever before.

<p>Sales organizations that thrive on a steady flow of inbound leads have an opportunity to leverage paid social for lead generation. LinkedIn digital marketing may be a viable option for some. Other companies may not fare so well. But if there’s a good fit, scaling up to a full-funnel digital marketing strategy on LinkedIn could be a reliable way to feed qualified inbound leads to your sales team.</p>



<h2>What type of company benefits from digital marketing on LinkedIn?</h2>



<p>Success with digital marketing on LinkedIn is really more about the audience than the product or service itself. If a business targets leads based on job titles, degrees, skills, or specific companies, LinkedIn is a viable ad platform. On the other hand, if a business wants to target a list of keywords or demographic profiles, Google or Facebook may be a better channel. That being said, here are two types of businesses that Silverback has seen success with LinkedIn ads:</p>



<h3>B2B SaaS&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Software-as-a-service companies who target a niche market or specific accounts are positioned well for digital marketing on LinkedIn. These companies typically target users based on job titles or company firmographics like employee size and industry, which is a key feature of LinkedIn’s targeting capabilities.</p>



<h3>Higher Education</h3>



<p>Universities who want to generate more enrollments in a postgraduate program may consider targeting users with a specific degree. With LinkedIn’s position as a robust recruiting tool, many users have their degrees on their public profiles. This allows higher ed marketers to target individuals based on the bachelor’s degrees they’ve earned. LinkedIn even has a targeting option for those who are “open to education”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How does LinkedIn view campaign objectives?</h2>



<p>Not all campaigns are equal. Organizations running ads on LinkedIn have different goals. <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/success/best-practices/choose-your-objective">According to LinkedIn</a>, campaign objectives are grouped into 3 categories:</p>



<p>• Awareness campaigns maximize your brand’s share-of-voice through impressions.</p>



<p>• Consideration campaigns encourage your customers to take action to find out more about your business. The actions are usually clicks that take them to a landing page, or other engagement such as encouraging social actions and views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Conversion campaigns are focused on lead generation and the ability to track actions on your website such as whitepaper downloads or lead generation capture.</p>



<h2>What is a full-funnel LinkedIn digital marketing strategy?</h2>



<p>LinkedIn has really grown in its abilities as an ad platform. Campaigns today can capture the attention of target buyers, and re-market to those individuals on the platform. For example, you can target users who have opened a lead form, filled one out, or watched a video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A full-funnel strategy on LinkedIn captures the attention of target users, engages them with value-rich content, and converts those users into demo requests or other sales opportunities. It leverages economies of scale to manage cost-per-lead, and accelerates brand visibility and growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, an awareness campaign would focus on grabbing users attention, then re-marketing to those users to build trust and familiarity.</p>



<p>Then, consideration campaigns re-market to engaged users with value-rich content like an original research study, ebook, or video course. Using LinkedIn lead gen forms captures users email address, valuable <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/what-is-first-party-data-how-can-marketers-use-it/">first-party data</a> that can be used to add a new communication channel: email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, conversion campaigns are where users take a significant action toward making a purchase, like booking a demo or requesting a consultation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: What is a &quot;full-funnel&quot; LinkedIn digital marketing strategy?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/07ebIYTdMgUcX0njJpTz1Z?si=gtieOp-nSv2l7BONgU4A1w&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>How do you build a full-funnel digital strategy on LinkedIn?</h2>



<p>Ideally, companies should launch awareness, consideration and conversion campaigns all at once to drive an optimal amount of leads and revenue. This approach requires an up-front investment to run each campaign on the platform. It also requires content needed to fuel each campaign. Companies able to launch all three at once may be in good position to take advantage of the platform.</p>



<p>However, some companies may face hurdles launching awareness or even consideration campaigns as part of a full-funnel approach. For instance, executive teams may question the importance of awareness campaigns, unable to draw a clear path to return on that investment.</p>



<p>In these less-than-ideal scenarios, it may be worth building from the bottom-up by launching a conversion campaign as a test to prove whether LinkedIn is a viable revenue generator. Over time, however, these campaigns can be costly to scale up and manage cost-per-lead thresholds, especially if the target customer has never heard from you, or won’t hear from you again (hence the importance of awareness and consideration campaigns).</p>



<p>Once a conversion-focused campaign starts generating revenue, companies can find success by developing a softer offer for a campaign with a consideration objective. For example, a B2B SaaS company may run a lead gen form campaign, offering a PDF benchmark report in exchange for a user’s email address. While not a hot sales opportunity, this action adds value through their thought leadership and allows the company to nurture the lead through email communications. It builds trust and brand familiarity with the prospect, creating more opportunity for sales conversations.</p>



<p>Finally, when consideration campaigns prove to fuel conversions and revenue, companies may consider scaling up awareness and visibility to capture the attention of a larger market. This can be useful for brands who wish to stay top-of-mind for prospects who are satisfied with their status quo. And if something were to change, they are familiar with the brand that captured their attention with a LinkedIn advertisement.</p>



<h2>What impact will data privacy have on LinkedIn campaigns?</h2>



<p>LinkedIn is a lot less affected by data privacy changes than other social platforms. For example, a lot of the information that you&#8217;re using to target folks on Facebook is gathered based on third-party cookies, but with LinkedIn it&#8217;s a lot more straightforward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Targeting users on LinkedIn is mostly based on a user’s profile: job titles, skills, their company’s industry, the groups they’ve joined. If an organization wanted to focus on LinkedIn as a primary lead-generation channel, a full-funnel strategy completely contained within the LinkedIn platform would make sense and would be shielded from many of the privacy-related changes affecting other platforms like <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/the-impact-of-apple-ios-145-on-facebook-ad-campaigns/">Facebook</a> or <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/google-floc-lessons-learned-from-the-privacy-sandbox-proposal/">Google</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If companies contain as many of their marketing activities and conversion points on LinkedIn’s platform as possible, they don’t have to worry about the third-party cookie issues many of the other platforms face when directing users to a company website.</p>



<h2>How should companies get started with LinkedIn digital marketing?</h2>



<p>Companies have two main options when it comes to scaling up a full-funnel LinkedIn digital marketing strategy: 1) do it in-house, or 2) outsource to an agency. There are pros and cons to both approaches. <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/marketing-strategy/marketing-agency-vs-in-house-paid-media-campaign-pros-cons-advice/">Read more about insourcing -vs- outsourcing paid media.</a></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you need to increase traffic on your website, the obvious option probably comes to mind first: Write a new page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there’s a way to earn more traffic without writing a new page. It doesn’t require you to research a new topic and package it in a way best serving your audience, and you won&#8217;t have to wait several months for it to rise to the top of Google search results — if it ever does.</p>



<p>Instead, you can refresh old content to give it an SEO boost.</p>



<h2>What is a Content Refresh?</h2>



<p>A content refresh involves identifying pages on your site that either:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Previously performed well, but traffic is down in recent months&nbsp;</li><li>Rank for several target keywords just outside of the top positions and has a chance to earn more clicks by rising a few spots.</li></ol>



<p>By assessing the content and determining why it experienced a traffic drop or what it could take to crack the top positions in Google, you can make the necessary updates.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: How do you refresh stale content for SEO?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/6v2hWDa2aZumBcBQA5jgz6?si=v_PPUMyGQRa6WVhMEW8YrQ&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>Steps to Refresh Content</h2>



<h4><strong>Identify Eligible Content</strong></h4>



<p>The first type of content primed for an update is content that previously drove significant amounts of organic traffic, but recently saw a drop. Using Google Analytics, check the organic traffic of each blog over a given period — for example, the past two years — and see if there are opportunities that jump out.</p>



<p>The page below is a good example of one that performed well, but saw a drop and has not fully recovered.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="992" height="234" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-1.png" alt="example graph of web page traffic that performed well, but saw a drop and has not fully recovered." class="wp-image-2164" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-1.png 992w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-1-300x71.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-1-768x181.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 992px" /></figure>



<p>When you see this type of traffic drop, you should first try to learn the reason for the drop. If the page is seasonal — and you expect traffic to peak in the summer months, drop in the winter, and come back in the summer — it’s not the best choice for a refresh, because no amount of high rankings in the winter is going to help it maintain its traffic.</p>



<p>On the other hand, a common cause for such a drop is a competitor now outranks your page and steals its clicks. SEO is not a one-and-done investment, because your competitors are always happy to take your spot in the search results, and as a result, turn them into their customers.</p>



<p>This situation is perfect for a refresh — you know if you update the page to be better than your competitor’s, you could reclaim your position in search results and the increased traffic&nbsp;with it.</p>



<p>The other type of page eligible for a refresh is one ranking within “striking distance” of high-volume keywords. There&#8217;s not an exact science to what’s considered within striking distance, but generally a page ranking for several keywords in positions four through 10 are a good fit.</p>



<p>Your page could see a jump into the top three rankings for those keywords if you make the necessary updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, TrainingPeak.com’s page on “<a href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/guides/marathon-training/">The Complete Marathon Training Guide</a>” ranks in positions four through 10 for 46 keywords, with a total search volume of 35,940 searches per month.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="219" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2-1024x219.png" alt="TrainingPeak.com’s page on “The Complete Marathon Training Guide” ranks in positions four through 10 for 46 keywords, with a total search volume of 35,940 searches per month." class="wp-image-2165" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2-1024x219.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2-300x64.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2-768x164.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2-1536x329.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-2.png 1682w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If it moved into the top three, they can earn a percentage of the thousands of clicks per month they’re missing.. This is a perfect opportunity for a refresh, because a small jump in rankings across a few dozen keywords could be the difference in thousands of new sessions per month.</p>



<h4><strong>Create a New List of Target Keywords</strong></h4>



<p>Whether you’re refreshing a page with a traffic drop or one with ample opportunities in striking distance, the next step is the same — create a new list of target keywords.</p>



<p>Using a tool such as Ahrefs or SEMrush, see which keywords the page ranks for in positions four through 10. The page will target those new keywords.</p>



<p>You should also note which keywords the page ranks for in positions one through three, because you don’t want the updates you make gain new keywords, only to lose valuable ones for which you already rank.</p>



<h4><strong>Analyze the Pages Ranking for Your New Target Keywords</strong></h4>



<p>The next step is learning what type of updates your page needs to earn or reclaim top three rankings. Google each target keyword and analyze the pages ranking ahead of yours.</p>



<p>There is a reason Google is choosing to rank pages above yours, and it’s your job to find out why.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.interest.com/mortgage/how-much-house-can-you-afford/">Interest.com ranks sixth</a> for “how much should i spend on a house.”</p>



<p>To learn what types of updates to make, they should review the five pages ranking above them for that keyword to determine why Google might see those pages as better fits for the query.</p>



<p>One obvious difference is top pages include a mortgage calculator where readers can enter their income, expenses, home price and interest rate, and the calculator gives them an estimate on the price of home and mortgage payment they can afford.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="924" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-3-1024x924.png" alt="Mortgage calculator where readers can get an estimate for monthly mortgage payments" class="wp-image-2167" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-3-1024x924.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-3-300x271.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-3-768x693.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-3.png 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It makes sense Google prioritizes pages with a calculator as the best answer to the query, because this helps users learn an exact answer to their question, instead of reading broad principles about income percentages.</p>



<p>One update Interest.com should make as part of their content refresh is adding an interactive mortgage calculator to their page.</p>



<p>The key is to identify what the top pages have in common and making sure your page has those elements. Take it a step farther to not only match those pages, but provide even more helpful content.</p>



<p>As another example, <a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/camp/camping-tip-how-to-sleep-warm">REI.com ranks fourth</a> for “how to stay warm camping.” Its page is about 500 words and includes five tips for keeping warm, followed by a brief description for each.</p>



<p>By analyzing the three pages ranking above it, some easy updates come to mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pages one, two and three feature nine, 13 and 15 tips respectively and average 2,300 words. That’s an easy opportunity for REI to update their page to include 10-15&nbsp;tips and 2,000+ words.</p>



<p>The site already has outdoor niche authority, so refreshing the content to be more comprehensive would likely cause a rankings jump.</p>



<h4><strong>Target the Featured Snippet</strong></h4>



<p>Featured snippets are the answer boxes at the top of search results attempting to answer the query without requiring the user to click through to the page. They appear in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/another-featured-snippet-study-shows-steal-significant-traffic-first-organic-result-275967">more than 12 percent of searches</a>, and they are even more common for the types of informational queries perfect for content refreshes.</p>



<p>You should intentionally target the featured snippet in your content refresh because snippets increase your site’s prominence in search results, and serving Google the answer by targeting the snippet could earn you a number one ranking it otherwise wouldn’t give you.</p>



<p>How do you target the snippet?</p>



<p>Look at the format of the current snippet. The primary formats of featured snippets are:</p>



<ul><li>Bulleted lists</li><li>Numbered lists</li><li>Paragraphs</li></ul>



<p>When you’re refreshing your page, always include an answer to the query in the format of the current featured snippet.</p>



<p>In our camping example, the featured snippet is a numbered list.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="545" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-4-1024x545.png" alt="Screen shot of the SERP featured snippet for &quot;how to stay warm camping&quot; which includes a numbered list" class="wp-image-2168" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-4-1024x545.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-4-300x160.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-4-768x409.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-4.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>So REI’s refresh of the page should maintain their current format of numbering their tips.</p>



<p>If the featured snippet is a paragraph, include a brief paragraph toward the top of your page directly answering the question. If it’s a bulleted list, either include a bulleted list on the page or include your answers to the query as H2 headers.</p>



<h4><strong>Watch Traffic Rebound</strong></h4>



<p>One of the many advantages of a content refresh over writing a new page is not needing to wait as long to see a traffic&nbsp; increase.</p>



<p>When publishing a new blog, expect to wait several months for the page to crack the top few positions in search results. But when you refresh content, the page is often already ranking and you can see a traffic rebound in a matter of weeks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="754" height="268" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-5.png" alt="Graph of weekly traffic increases after implementing a content refresh" class="wp-image-2169" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-5.png 754w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/content-refresh-5-300x107.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></figure>



<p>Additionally, not every page on your site will be a hit. While some might get thousands of sessions per month, others might get only a few dozen. By opting for a content refresh instead of a new page, you are doubling down on a (perhaps previously) successful page, minimizing the risk of a low-performing page.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Marketers can take advantage of first-party data in paid media campaigns by learning how to use lookalike audiences on platforms. Lookalike audiences populate a larger group of potential customers based on your own uploaded target audience. This increases your reach and ability to target audiences of similar demographics and interests.</p>



<p>Marketers around the country spent the last few months preparing for an increased need for first-party data. This effort is driven by consumers’ increasing demand to have control over their own data, and major industry players’ recent shifts towards privacy for their users. Individuals want the ability to know who is seeing their online activity, and provide permission for them to do so. It’s now easier than ever to give that power back to the user.</p>



<p>In particular, Apple decided to ask consumers if they’d like to opt-in to in-app behavior tracking in their new iOS 14 update (and subsequent 14 iterations). Since iPhones and Mac computers are prolific, major advertising platforms were forced to adjust their own data-collection capabilities to adhere to this new privacy standard.</p>



<p>The most notable adjustment for marketers is the decreased visibility into user demographic information. There’s no longer a way to pinpoint particular users and follow their online journeys. Instead, broad targeting of potential customers will now rely on “lookalike audiences.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What is a lookalike audience?</h2>



<p>A lookalike audience is a machine-learning-generated audience built on first-party data gathered from your existing target audience lists. Lookalike audiences on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google differ slightly, but the concept remains the same: An audience of users similar to the people you’ve targeted in the past.</p>



<p>Using a lookalike audience provides a larger pool of individuals who share similar interests or browsing behavior as your existing audience. For instance, if you want to advertise a running shoe, uploading a list of shoe-purchasing customers would help the algorithms serve ads to individuals who may have similar interests or behaved similarly in the past.</p>



<h2>How do lookalike audiences work?</h2>



<p>At the very simplest level, you upload your own first-party user data into the platform of your choice. For Google, they then apply their proprietary methodology to filter out unusable individuals to match with their broader database. If enough users make it through filters, they’ll create an audience of people similar enough to the uploaded data to provide a promising group. Because of privacy updates like Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, some of the factors in creating a lookalike audience are more difficult than before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s methodology also provides a great example of how to use lookalike audiences.</p>



<p>You must upload at least 1,000 contacts. Then, Google filters out anyone who isn’t a Google user, then removes anyone flagged as a violation of personal advertising policies. Finally, it now removes anyone who opted out of tracking or ad personalization.</p>



<p>As the final layer of filtering, if any remaining individuals aren’t daily active users, they’re removed. After applying these layers of qualification, a 1,500-person list might only yield 100 users. With such a small sample size, the list is rendered useless and won’t provide any data.</p>



<p>A complicating factor is the match rate. While in the example above, the final product didn’t produce enough data for a similar audience. Yet, this example may produce a 90% match rate. This is because 1,500 of the users on the list qualified as usable, but after Google’s aggressive filtering, only a slim amount of the 90% remained. However, Google itself has less information available to them with new privacy controls in place, so match rates will start to fall and become a larger problem.</p>



<p>This methodology is similar across other popular platforms, like Facebook and LinkedIn. For Facebook, you can use the data collected from a pixel already active in a campaign. Otherwise, you can upload a list of your own, similar to Google’s process.</p>



<p>Because of LinkedIn’s reputation as a professional gathering platform, keyword search terms don’t fact in at all. Much like the other requirements, users upload a list of their own to generate a lookalike audience up to 15 times larger than the original source. Demographics are a particular area of change for LinkedIn’s lookalike audience. Factors like company attributes and personal characteristics aid the algorithm. However, they will not use sensitive information. For instance, you cannot create an audience exclusively of female professionals with “manager” in their titles. </p>



<h2>Why marketers should learn how to use lookalike audiences</h2>



<p>With marketers soon to have fewer targeting capabilities on social media platforms, lookalike audiences will be key to expanding your reach beyond site visitors. This is one feature that will likely remain intact once third-party cookies are completely deprecated. Even without visibility into individuals’ activity across platforms, lookalike audiences will provide a similar set of prospective customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the limitations of iOS privacy changes put marketers’ focus on new ways to advertise to target customers. While you’ll still be able to account for ad fatigue controls, you’ll want to refresh your creative faster than ever to better ensure you’re appealing to a broader selection of interests.</p>



<p>Additionally, the original source of data needs to be robust. A first-party data strategy is critical in ensuring you’ll be able to provide enough volume of contacts to use a lookalike audience. The more contacts you upload, the more likely it will survive the multiple layers of privacy-focused filtering.</p>



<p>Once you’ve fulfilled those conditions, you’ll have a lookalike audience operating similarly to campaigns of the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember to build your campaigns and creative around the attributes used in creating the lookalike audiences. If you’re targeting individuals who make vegan-oriented searches, don’t serve content outside of that dietary parameter.</p>



<p>Above all, lookalike audiences work to give you more people to reach outside of your owned contacts. Use them to your advantage by creating compelling creative and helpful content to fulfill the search queries or keywords they use.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Learning how to use lookalike audiences will be critical in an age of more privacy and less information for marketers. There won’t be opportunities to track particular site visitors’ movements through different sites to retarget. By using the best information you can collect with a first-party data strategy, you increase your potential to use a lookalike audience full of truly qualified people. However, without enough of your own quality data, lookalike audiences could be hard to come by.</p>

<p>As of October, 2020 marketers no longer have the ability to set up Google’s Universal Analytics accounts to track website performance. Websites that had Universal Analytics prior were grandfathered in. Instead, new websites will need to learn how to set up Google Analytics 4.<br><br>This doesn’t mean websites operating on Universal Analytics will never have to make the switch. In fact, these websites should set up Google Analytics 4 sooner rather than later to start accumulating data and setting up reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article will help marketers understand how to set up Google Analytics 4 for a seamless transition to the new model. It’s important to be aware of these changes, because without a firm grasp, marketers won’t be able to get what they need to analyze site performance.</p>



<h2>How to Set Up Google Analytics 4</h2>



<p>The key for setting up Google Analytics 4 is to not abandon your legacy reporting in Universal Analytics. The transition will not be immediate, so when getting started in Google Analytics 4, Universal Analytics will fill in any data gaps while you acclimate to the new platform.</p>



<p>There is a Google Analytics 4 Setup Assistant within the platform’s administration tools. For those with gtag.js, once you select the appropriate property, the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10312255?hl=en">setup wizard</a> will do the heavy lifting for you.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="532" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz-1024x532.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2057" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz-1024x532.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz-300x156.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz-768x399.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz-1536x797.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-Wiz.png 1680w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you use a website plugin, Google Tag Manager or an analytics.js snippet, you&#8217;ll need to go about placing the Google Analytics 4 HTML yourself. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="462" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2-1024x462.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2058" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2-1024x462.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2-300x135.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2-768x346.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2-1536x693.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Set-Up-2.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Luckily, Google Tag Manager already has pre-built tags if you are looking for a relatively painless way to upgrade your tracking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="462" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager-1024x462.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2059" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager-1024x462.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager-300x135.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager-768x346.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager-1536x693.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tag-Manager.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>How is Google Analytics 4 Focused on Privacy?</h2>



<p>At the most basic level, Google Analytics is now very privacy-centric to comply with new data privacy regulations. While it’s still possible to access the key findings Google Analytics typically provided, it’s categorized differently to better allow users to comply with privacy laws. This is most evident in an overhaul of the data model.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="442" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic-1024x442.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2056" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic-1024x442.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic-768x332.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic-1536x663.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blog-Graphic.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Rather than sharing specific actions like page views, Google Analytics 4 now labels actions broadly using the word “<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9322688?hl=en">events</a>” to anonymize data. Events can be anything from site visits to clicks. While you’ll get data, it’s deeply generalized so you’ll get to track conversions and attributions. But, you won’t be able to identify or track users for those choosing to preserve their privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How does Google Analytics 4 Store Data Differently?</h2>



<p>Data storage is where much of the data privacy adjustments are most prominent. Universal Analytics defaulted to a specific time limit on data storage. But, you could override it if you wanted to keep it for longer. Google Analytics 4 removes the override function, meaning you only have 14 months of storage without exception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Google Analytics 4 now directly links to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a>. This means you no longer need to work with a third party to store data on your end, making the external storage limits easier to manage. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: Google Analytics 4: How Should Marketers Approach it in 2021?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/1isRQblVIscVdDMb3mzc1B?si=A2gvjMpcQ-Wrg3Q-Z8TI_g&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>As a benefit, Google Analytics 4 ties each event to the user now, rather than by events within sessions. This makes it much easier for marketers to identify all actions attributed to a user, unlike with Universal Analytics where all sessions might not be correctly tied. With this new user-focused data structure, it is much easier to handle privacy requests to remove someone&#8217;s data.</p>



<p>This is extremely important now, because as soon as your data is moved from Google Analytics 4 onto one of your properties, it is your responsibility to comply with the new data privacy legislation. While owning this process isn’t new, the stakes are higher. You can use Google Analytics 4’s request feature to provide the pertinent user information and instruct them to delete.</p>



<h2>How are Reports Different in Google Analytics 4?</h2>



<p>Also, Google Analytics 4 won’t provide you with pre-built templates, so you’ll need to think ahead and build these frameworks for yourself. For instance, there are less pre-grouped reports. While it’s still possible to build them yourself based on the metrics you need, they’re not immediately forthcoming with deep data sets. This allows for more flexibility overall, but puts a little more work on your plate to group together what you need.</p>



<h2>Does Google Analytics 4 Make it Easier to Identify Users?</h2>



<p>In Universal Analytics, user identification was a little complex to interpret. Using the two categories available, whether User ID or Client ID, you couldn’t unify the view and consolidate sessions for any one user.</p>



<p>Now, Google Analytics 4 employs several methods to cross-reference and deduplicate users. While the amount of returns or unique users you have might be lower than expected, you can have more faith in the veracity of the data since it’s been compiled from multiple sources.</p>



<h2>Will My Website Traffic Be Subject to Sampling?</h2>



<p>If you have large amounts of traffic and decide to combine metrics beyond the typical scope of pre-aggregated tables, you will eventually find yourself subject to sampling. Sampling is the process of analyzing a subset of data for study and reporting based on the similarity detected within it, plus the larger data set. Google Analytics 4 always samples several reports while  not sampling a few others. <br><br>Google Analytics 4 will use only a small amount of the data to provide reports. But, let’s say it only processes 1% of your traffic, the reports won’t be accurate unless the 1% is a good representation of your entire data set. Again, though, sampling typically only applies to websites with high traffic.</p>
