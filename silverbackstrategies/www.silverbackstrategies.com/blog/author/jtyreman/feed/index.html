										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Google FLoC, or the “Federated Learning of Cohorts,” was a proposal for a new model to track users and target ads without using third-party cookies. Yet it failed to gain support from consumers, platforms, and governments. Now, Google has delayed plans to block third-party cookies until 2023. This article explains what companies running campaigns on Google Ads needs to know.</p>



<h2>What was Google FLoC, anyway?</h2>



<p>Google’s original plan was to transition from their current user tracking model, which relied on third-party tracking pixels, also known as “cookies,” over the course of 2021. In its place, Google proposed a solution where advertisers would be able to target users by their interest and behavior in groups called “cohorts” based on websites they visit. Google would group  anonymous users expressing similar interests. Instead of using third-party cookies, user activity would be tracked with Google’s own <em>first-</em>party cookies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">Google</a>, FLoC “proposes a new way for businesses to reach people with relevant content and ads by clustering large groups of people with similar interests. This approach effectively hides individuals ‘in the crowd’ and uses on-device processing to keep a person’s web history private on the browser.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why did the Google FLoC trial end?</h2>



<p>FLoC was the best of both worlds to Google—compliant with data privacy laws, but retained enough user insight to deliver similar levels of advertising performance. But the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)’s investigation into the company’s Privacy Sandbox approach appears to be a major factor in Google’s decision to end the FLoC trial on July 13th and delay their plans to block third-party cookies until Q3 or Q4 of 2023.</p>



<p>Google’s market position doesn’t help make allies with other browsers to support FLoC. Sixty-five percent of internet users use Chrome. Naturally, competitors like Mozilla, Microsoft, and Opera <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387492/google-floc-ad-tech-privacy-browsers-brave-vivaldi-edge-mozilla-chrome-safari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reacted lukewarmly</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/4IqfjM7YYNwM7hag8PkR7nmYkwnt1VG9EFEIGkVXjAUAfEarZBcVMTTf-zU5GyLRToN6lZhEbd9uTzy3Ot03CvXvQhuxzVJbNDJ2AE6s8butm65oAYHLz8xVUckviWvif2TyYUXD" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For digital marketers and businesses who run ads on Google, FLoC didn’t seem like it would have a big impact on campaigns. It was similar to the existing cookie-based model. Google FLoC essnetially would use first-party cookies to gather data, then Google would serve advertisements using machine learning to gauge user interest by analyzing browser history.</p>



<p>This did not sit well with privacy advocates who believe Google cannot be trusted.</p>



<p>WordPress—a platform that hosts more than 40% of all websites—<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wordpress-proposal-block-floc/402978/">proposed blocking Google FLoC</a> because they deemed it a “security threat.” However, even WordPress received backlash from their community for this stance. Some questioned whether blocking FLoC was truly a security issue or just political posturing. Some argued this to be an issue solved at the individual level, where users can opt-in to “join” Google FLoC or to remain anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the pressure from all sides made FLoC an unrealistic way to replace the current third-party tracking pixel methodology. Google, the market leader, will have to go back to the drawing board. The new 2023 date gives Google more time to develop solutions that will be accepted by governments, platforms, and the public.</p>



<h2>What will Google do next?</h2>



<p>Google will post a “more detailed schedule” on Google’s Privacy Sandbox website. But, Google laid out a two-stage plan to deprecate third-party cookies and develop other privacy-compliant solutions for advertisers:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stage 1 (Starting late-2022):</strong> Google will announce the start of stage 1 once they complete testing and launch APIs in Chrome. During stage 1, publishers and the advertising industry will have time to migrate their services. We expect this stage to last for nine months, and we will monitor adoption and feedback carefully before moving to stage 2.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Stage 2 (Starting mid-2023):</strong> Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies over a three-month period finishing in late 2023.</li></ul>

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Spotify Embed: Google delays cookie crackdown. What now?" width="100%" height="232" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0s2k782tZXqpjcYxXr7UmW?si=AmnnuknqQYSMqjn7LfrM3A&#038;dl_branch=1"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2>What does this mean for companies running ads?</h2>



<p>2023 is when major changes will take place to Google Ads campaigns migrating to a new methodology. Digital agencies will need to guide their clients through this transition with the right strategy. If you do not have a plan in place to transition to the new model, it could have a major impact on campaign performance.</p>



<p>Leading up to that point, companies should prioritize collecting and activating first-party audience data. This will be essential to build trust with target customers and fuel digital campaigns through practices like “lookalike audiences,” powered by machine learning. Many believe some variation of this practice will remain available to marketers, and could be a focal point of the new advertising model.</p>

<p>Third party cookies’ stay of execution is a silver lining. It provides more time for marketers to become data-savvy before it’s too late. But building and scaling a first-party data strategy takes time. If it has not already been a major focus for your company, it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the wake of new data privacy laws and device settings, marketers are getting a crash course in the importance of first-party data. If you’re reading this you’re likely a marketer asking questions like, “What is first-party data?” and, “How do I use it in my strategy?” This article will help you answer both of those questions.</p>



<h2>What is First-Party Data?</h2>



<p>First-party data is information you gather directly from your audience. This kind of information can be collected both online or offline, manually or automatically. Examples include:</p>



<ul><li>Customer profile data in your CRM</li><li>Behavioral data from your website</li><li>Data from social media profiles</li><li>Survey data you collect</li><li>Subscription data</li><li>Purchase history</li></ul>



<h2><br>Why is First-Party Data Important?</h2>



<p>New data privacy laws like CCPA set off a chain of events leading tech giants like Apple and Google to introduce new privacy settings on iPhone and Android devices. You may have seen Apple’s advertisement about their new App Tracking Transparency feature:</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8w4qPUSG17Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p><br>As more users take advantage of privacy features like this, it will make it <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/the-impact-of-apple-ios-145-on-facebook-ad-campaigns/">harder for marketers to analyze audience behavior</a> on ad platforms like Facebook and Google. This is due in part to new privacy settings, but also because third-party tracking pixels, or “cookies,” will eventually be blocked. <br><br>While blocking third-party cookies has been <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-pushes-back-plan-to-block-third-party-cookies-until-2023-349877">delayed by Google to 2023</a>, it is still important for marketers to have a plan for addressing this shift to the advertising landscape. No longer having access to this kind of third-party data will make companies prioritize their own <em>first-party</em> data if they want to analyze audience demographics, personalize messages and target niche segments.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/whitepaper/how-to-build-scale-first-party-data-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg" alt="Download our free eBook titled &quot;How to Build and Scale a First-Party Data Strategy&quot;" class="wp-image-2034" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blog-cta-home-services-report-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h2>What is the Difference Between First-, Second- and Third-Party Data?</h2>



<p>The primary difference between first-, second- and third-party data is the source. Companies have historically relied on other sources to build out their datasets.</p>



<p><strong>Second-Party Data</strong></p>



<p>Second-party data is first-party data one company receives from another. For example, a hotel chain wants more information about its customer base, so it purchases customer data from an airline or local travel agency. Second-party data is still high-quality because it comes directly from consumers, and it can help you increase your dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Third-Party Data</strong></p>



<p>With third-party data, there is no direct relationship between your company and the consumer. Third-party data is typically gathered via cookies on global platforms like Facebook and <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/data-privacy/google-floc-a-glimpse-into-marketing-without-third-party-cookies/">Google</a>. These platforms then aggregated that data into audience segments, which they used to target ads and generate reports.</p>



<p><strong>Zero-Party Data</strong></p>



<p>Technically a type of first-party data, the term “zero-party data” is information volunteered by customers. For example, a prospect completes a contact form on your website with fields for name and email, plus a comment box. There they mention their business is located in Chesterfield. Since their geographic location was not explicitly asked for, the volunteered information is zero-party.</p>



<h2>How Can Marketers Collect First-Party Data?</h2>



<p>Consumers are waking up to the importance of their personal information. Marketers will need to examine the value of their content and promotions offered in exchange for personal identifiable information (PII) like names and email addresses. Here are examples of how companies can collect this kind of data from their audience:</p>



<ul><li>Make it easy for users to accept first-party cookies on your website</li><li>Offer discount codes or coupons in exchange for email address</li><li>Create quizzes or other game-like experiences for users</li><li>Allow users to create an account profile on your website</li><li>Offer rewards programs for repeat customers</li><li>Offer high-value content behind a form</li><li>Ask users to participate in a survey</li></ul>



<p></p>

<h2>How Can Marketers Activate Customer Data?</h2>



<p><strong>Email Marketing</strong></p>



<p>Email has been a mainstay in marketing mixes for decades now, and it’s not going away. With fewer channels to target direct-response advertisements and offers, email will be more important for revenue conversions. It will be one of few channels marketers will be able to use to personalize messages and build niche audience segments based on demographic information.<br><br><a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/marketing-strategy/email-deliverability-and-how-it-affects-your-digital-marketing/">Read More: Email Deliverability and How It Affects Your Digital Marketing</a></p>



<p><strong>Audience Building</strong></p>



<p>You can use data in your CRM to inform machine learning on platforms like Facebook to build lookalike audiences. However, with more users filtered out from ad targeting due to privacy settings, marketers will need a higher volume of contacts for machine learning technology to match lists to cohorts of similar users. This means campaigns targeting highly niche audiences will likely become ineffective. Instead, campaigns may need to be consolidated to account for shrinking audience sizes available to target.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/5TnzDYVJ9a6dH2MwT4tfNN" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p><strong>Dynamic Content</strong></p>



<p>Depending on how robust your dataset is, your website can showcase dynamic content based on fields like geographic location, industry, or even specifics to the account. This is especially useful for B2B organizations with an account-based marketing (ABM) strategy. Imagine if a prospect at a target account visits your website and is served content showcasing relevant industry expertise or case stories of how your company helped a company like theirs. This would be a powerful way to leverage data to create a more personalized user experience.</p>



<h2>How Can Marketers Build and Scale a Data Strategy?</h2>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for collecting and using first-party data. Each company is in a different phase of their growth and serves unique audiences. If you’re a marketer who wants to get serious about building and scaling a data strategy, there are a few ways Silverback Strategies can help:</p>

<p>Not all homeowners are ready to make a purchase <em>right now</em>. And that’s OK. But you should understand the different behavior prospects show at each stage of the customer journey. This can be done by collecting data at key listening posts along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article overviews the customer journey in home services and shares research, stories and examples of listening posts service providers can measure. If you are a business owner or marketer who wishes to adapt your marketing to shifts in buyer behavior, please bookmark this page. </p>

<h2>What is the customer journey in home services?</h2>



<p>When consumers realize they have a need for a product or service they go through a series of events that result in a purchase. There are endless path combinations a customer can take on their journey. To simplify we have distilled it into 5 stages based on behavior:</p>



<ol><li>Realization&nbsp;</li><li>Education</li><li>Evaluation</li><li>Decision</li><li>Advocacy&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>What is a listening post?</h2>



<p>A listening post is a point along a customer journey where companies can gather information and feedback about the behavior of their target customers.</p>



<p>On its own, one listening post can yield actionable insight about specific channels or platforms. When aggregated together, many listening posts can illustrate a much bigger picture. This kind of <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/research/home-services-marketing-research-a-foundation-for-customer-centric-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing research</a> can lay the foundation for a customer-centric strategy.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through each stage of the customer journey and identify examples of listening posts you can use to gather insight about your audience.</p>



<h2>Stage 1. Realization</h2>



<p>This is&nbsp; the moment when customers recognize they have a problem to solve.<br><br>There are events in our everyday lives that can trigger a need to make a purchase. For example, I live in a log cabin and need to seal the exterior-facing wood every few years to protect against water damage and pests. This is a purchase that I know is coming, and can plan for it.</p>



<p>There are also unexpected events that can trigger a need. For instance, when my basement flooded because of a busted hot water heater, there was an important, and urgent, need to get it fixed.</p>



<p>In both cases, the first thing I did was go online to find a service provider to call and schedule an appointment. I’m not alone in this behavior. In a recent study on buyers of home services, nearly 60% went online when they first realized they needed a service provider.</p>



<p>Here are some key listening posts to leverage at the realization stage of the customer journey:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Social Media</strong> — if you’ve taken the time to build an audience on social media, you have a valuable market feedback tool. If you don’t have the luxury of an engaged audience, you can run polls or surveys through paid campaigns targeted at your ideal customers.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Search Engines</strong> — periodic keyword research will help marketers understand how ideal customers phrase their search queries. <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/blog/seo/understanding-search-intent-for-seo-the-ultimate-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Understanding search intent for SEO</a> will help guide your content creation efforts.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Review Sites</strong> — read customer reviews from your customers, but also read reviews of other service providers. These insights will tell you the problems that were solved through their purchase, but will also show you how your customers talk about those problems.</li></ul>



<h2>Stage 2. Education</h2>



<p>This is&nbsp; how customers gather the information they need to make a decision. This is especially important if it is a major purchase.</p>



<p>Using my log cabin example, when I searched for “<em>how to seal my log home</em>” I considered doing the work myself. I’m pretty handy. A company called <a href="https://www.permachink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perma-Chink Systems</a> kept popping up when I searched for those key words. They had some great content to help me understand what materials and tools I needed to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the busted water heater example, there wasn’t much education. All I needed to know was which service providers are in my area, and when can I schedule an appointment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some key listening posts to leverage at the education stage of the customer journey:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Company Blog</strong> — With an educational approach to content, you can monitor post performance by organic search sessions. The topics of top-performing posts can inform new content, or which posts to update more frequently.<br></li><li><strong>On-Site Search Queries</strong> — Users may not be ready to have a conversation, but they may use the search function on your blog or website to find the information they need to solve their problem. Looking at how users phrase certain search queries can help inform content strategy.</li></ul>



<h2>Stage 3. Evaluation</h2>



<p>This is where consumers judge different contractors based on various criteria. For more transactional services it could be as simple as speed and cost. But for purchases needing more consideration, like home construction, our research shows consumers were more likely to use criteria like “examples of past performance” and “online ratings and reviews.”</p>



<p>Sealing my log home was too big of a job to take on myself. I needed to find a service provider. Since this was a pretty niche service, there were only a few companies fitting my top three criteria:&nbsp; past performance, cost, and service in my area.</p>



<p>For the busted hot water heater, my evaluation was simple. I wanted it fixed fast. I found a few companies in my online search. But it was a Sunday, and most of my calls went to voicemail.&nbsp; I finally got through to <a href="https://culpeperhomeservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Culpeper Home Services</a> who said they could be at my house within an hour.</p>



<p>These examples show the range of actions a buyer might take while evaluating various alternatives. Here are some key listening posts to leverage at this stage of the customer journey:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Email inquiries</strong> — Email can be used to get a sense of the questions prospects seek to answer when they’re ready to have a conversation.&nbsp; Compiling email inquiries together and looking at common problems or the way prospects phrase their needs can be helpful in crafting marketing messages and content.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Call recordings </strong>— Transcripts from call centers can yield useful insights to guide marketing strategy. Customers can also articulate things differently on the phone than they do in an email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Live chat or chatbots</strong> — If you have the content ready to answer key customer questions live as they are browsing your website, you’re more likely to&nbsp; establish trust and credibility. Customer messages can also be analyzed to inform new marketing tactics and strategies to test.</li></ul>



<h2>Stage 4. Decision</h2>



<p><br>This is where customers decide with whom to work. This is the moment they sign a contract or agree to a scope of work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For home service companies, the&nbsp; initial conversation with any prospective customer is critical. Depending on the industry, roughly one-third of home service buyers talked to only one service provider. A good&nbsp;first impression can go a long way.</p>



<p>Deciding on contractors for the two examples mentioned above was simple, but for different reasons. The company we selected to seal our log home was the only provider accepting projects. And the busted water heater was such an urgent priority that just being ready and on-call was what won my business.</p>



<p>Here are some key listening posts at the decision stage of the customer journey:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CRM data</strong> — Look at the reasons you lost business. There are a number of factors that may impact <em>why</em> a customer chose one provider over another. Asking prospects why they decided to go with another provider, then analyzing the data, will show how your business can become more competitive.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Customer questions </strong>— Customers tend to have many questions before and after deciding on a contractor. Home service providers can record the various questions customers ask at this stage. This information can help contractors address these questions for future customers before they are asked.</li></ul>



<h2>Stage 5. Advocacy</h2>



<p>This is&nbsp; when customers feel compelled to leave a rating or review online, which can be powerful marketing assets. Our research showed nearly&nbsp; half of home services buyers left these testimonials. Service providers must coordinate with&nbsp; front line workers — technicians, installers, or other representatives — to ask customers for a rating or review. Then,&nbsp; digital channels like email can be used to follow up with customers.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest; I did not have a good experience with the contractor who sealed my home. An ambiguous project start date caused confusion, water pumps tapped my well, and stain was sloppily applied. Had this contractor done a better job, their company would be mentioned in this article.</p>



<p>Culpeper Home Services, however, did an outstanding job replacing my hot water heater. Hence the shout out and link back to their website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some sample listening posts at the advocacy stage of the customer journey:</p>



<p><strong>Sample Listening Posts:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Third-party review sites</strong> — What do customers say in the reviews after they’ve received your service? This information can be incredibly valuable to companies who want to improve customer satisfaction and extend the lifetime value of customers.<br></li><li><strong>Social media </strong>— Like review sites, do customers have positive or negative things to say about you on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? Are they able to tag your profile on these platforms? Periodic branded searches on key social platforms can help you understand customer sentiment or if there is an issue needing to be addressed swiftly.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Client surveys</strong> — Gauge the value of your services and customer feedback with periodic surveys to recent customers. Here you have control over what questions you ask, eliciting direct feedback. However, customers may need incentive to take a survey.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>When mapped and analyzed properly, these touchpoints offer insight into each stage of the customer journey. Understanding this journey will show where your home services company needs to evolve.</p>

<p>When consumers realize they need to purchase a service for themselves or their home, they move along what’s known as a customer journey — a series of events that result in selecting a provider to work with.</p>



<p>Customers can take many paths on their journey. To simplify, we have distilled the customer journey into five stages based on behavior:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Realization —</strong>&nbsp;the moment when customers recognize they have a problem to solve.</li><li><strong>Education —</strong>&nbsp;how customers gather the information they need to make a decision.</li><li><strong>Evaluation —</strong>&nbsp;the criteria customers use to see if a service provider is a good fit.</li><li><strong>Decision —</strong>&nbsp;how customers decide on who to work with.</li><li><strong>Advocacy —</strong>&nbsp;when customers feel compelled to leave a rating or review online.</li></ol>



<h2>About the Research</h2>



<p>This research study intends to help marketers in consumer service industries like residential construction, landscaping, and bug &amp; pest understand buyer behavior so they can make strategic marketing investments. We are giving it away for free so these businesses have a resource they can turn to for market insights about the modern buyer.</p>



<p>In August of 2020, Silverback Strategies surveyed 1,066 U.S. adults who had recently purchased a service for themselves or their home. Survey questions focused on their most recent purchase experience — starting when they first realized they had a problem, all the way through making a purchase and leaving an online review. We analyzed the data and have made&nbsp;<a "http://silverbackstrategies.com/whitepaper/the-customer-journey-in-consumer-services-an-original-research-study-on-buyer-behavior-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full report</a>&nbsp;available to you.</p>

<p>If you’re a marketer in a consumer service industry, I recommend you bookmark this page or future reference. Below, you will find an executive summary of the research highlighting five key findings and what they mean for marketers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>When buyers first realized they needed help solving a problem, 57% went online.</h2>



<p>The customer journey begins when buyers realize they need help solving a problem.</p>



<p>Sometimes buyers realize it gradually. Homeowners who plan to construct an addition to their house may research and evaluate architects, engineers or construction contractors over months or years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other times, a need may happen in an instant. A tree might fall on a homeowner’s house and they&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/work/long-roofing">need a roofing company</a>&nbsp;to fix the problem as soon as possible.</p>



<p>In any case, this realization creates demand for a service.</p>



<p>We wanted to know the very first thing buyers did after they realized they needed a service. A full 57% of respondents identified going online in some shape or form, while only 19% contacted a past provider (Figure 4A).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="700" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics_201201_101322.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1532" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics_201201_101322.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics_201201_101322-300x263.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics_201201_101322-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Marketers must capture the attention of buyers online and be there when they need help. This can be done with content and core marketing messages focused on solving customer problems relevant to your services. Then, the content and marketing messages must be visible to customers on the channels they use to begin their customer journey.</p>



<h2>Nearly 97% of buyers use at least one social media platform weekly or more frequently.</h2>



<p>Outside of search engines, social media was the next most common online channel buyers used to begin their customer journey.</p>



<p>Service providers with an active social media presence have an advantage in the education stage of the buyer’s journey, as customers who are active on certain platforms may already be exposed to service provider brands already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the survey results, nearly 97% of respondents reported using at least one social media platform weekly or more frequently. Facebook, YouTube and Instagram were the most-used platforms (Figure 8).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="700" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics2_201201_101407.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1533" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics2_201201_101407.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics2_201201_101407-300x263.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics2_201201_101407-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>There are both organic and paid approaches to maintaining brand awareness on social media. But both require a mix of three key ingredients:</p>



<ul><li><em>Content —</em>&nbsp;value-rich, educational content aimed at solving specific problems helps customers in the education stage of their journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><em>Customer Profiles —</em>&nbsp;knowing who your content and message is for will focus your organic efforts and targeting criteria for paid campaigns.</li><li><em>Consistency —</em>&nbsp;social media content has a short lifespan.&nbsp; Service providers must maintain a consistent presence on social media to use it as a viable lead generation channel.</li></ul>



<p>For marketers, visibility is a big challenge at the education stage of the customer journey. A consistently active presence on social media can make companies top-of-mind when customers do their research.</p>



<h2>Price, customer reviews, and past performance were among the top criteria buyers use to evaluate consumer service providers.</h2>



<p>Buyers use various criteria to pick a service provider. Price was the most common factor used, but it was often combined with others. On average, respondents identified 2.7 of the eight different criteria listed in Figure 11.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer ratings and reviews continued to show relevance further along the customer journey, identified by 45% of respondents. At this stage, customers can live vicariously through their peers and draw from collective experience to help evaluate service providers.</p>



<p>Notably, ‘examples of past performance’ was identified by more than one-third of respondents. Seeing examples of past work can reduce anxiety and build trust.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="700" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1536" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics3.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics3-300x263.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics3-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>At this stage of the customer journey, marketers should highlight successful past work through customer testimonials and case stories. Make it clear your people understand customer problems and can empathize, or perhaps offer advice. This could be done at scale on platforms like YouTube.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, plumbers can record simple fixes like toilet or faucet repair as a ‘how-to’ video series. Not only does this help search visibility, but it builds trust by demonstrating experience and expertise.</p>



<h2>Nearly 30% of buyers only talked to one service provider, creating an advantage for companies with high marketplace visibility.</h2>



<p>At the decision stage of the customer journey, buyers have done their research and feel confident in their evaluation. It’s now time to make a decision and select a service provider.</p>



<p>Companies proactive enough to get in front of buyers early in their journey have an advantage over competitors. Nearly 30% of respondents said they only talked to one service provider before making a decision (Figure 12).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="700" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1535" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics4.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics4-300x263.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics4-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>A combined 55% of respondents talked to two or three service providers. Only 9% of buyers talked to four or more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Building brand awareness in the early stages of the customer journey can pay dividends in the decision stage. For marketers, the initial conversation is important in giving a good first impression. That conversation can happen on social media DMs, over email, on a phone call and on other channels. Marketers must work with sales representatives to keep messages consistent and highlight key differentiators and relevant past performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Less than 49% of buyers left ratings or reviews for their most recent service provider.</h2>



<p>After customers solve their problem, they are able to reflect and assign a value to their purchase decision. If that value does not meet the expectations set along their journey, marketers risk a customer who feels buyer’s remorse. This can be avoided with proper expectations.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when customers experience an overwhelming positive emotion from an experience, they tend to share it with peers. When your customers reach this state, they can become a valuable marketing asset. Ratings and reviews play a role at each stage of the customer journey.</p>



<p>While powerful, receiving customer ratings and reviews can be a challenge for marketers. Less than half of respondents left a rating of a review for their most recent service provider (Figure 14).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="700" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1534" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics5.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics5-300x263.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Consumer-Journey-Research-Report_Blog-Graphics5-768x672.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>Marketers may consider working with peers on the front lines — technicians, installers, and other customer points of contact — to ask customers to leave a rating or review. Marketers can also leverage digital channels like email follow-ups to solicit ratings and reviews from recent customers.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Buyer behavior has shifted dramatically in recent years as more transactions happen online, and as consumers become accustomed to searching for information on mobile and voice search. <br><br>This presents an opportunity for marketers to shift away from traditional media marketing activities like TV and radio to more practical and measurable digital marketing activities.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, retail marketing budgets have been slashed without revenue goals cut the same way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Independent retailers are forced to do more marketing with fewer resources. All while dealing with evolving revenue models and getting a crash course on ecommerce digital marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some sectors have seen tremendous growth this year. According to McKinsey, ecommerce sales in apparel, department stores, and beauty products have increased by nearly ten percentage points, on average, since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p>Others have not fared so well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even as most retail stores opened up over the Summer of 2020, many consumers still chose to shop online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how will this shift in buyer behavior impact how independent retailers go to market?</p>



<p>Will these companies embrace new revenue generation models?</p>



<p>This article intends to help independent retailers answer these questions and more.</p>



<h2>Ecommerce Digital Marketing is on the Rise</h2>



<p>Over the past few years, brick and mortar stores have felt the effects of a major shift in consumer behavior. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-ecommerce-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eMarketer’s US Ecommerce 2020 Study</a>, annual US ecommerce sales in 2020 project to be $710 billion — 18% growth over 2019, and up 54% since 2017. Purchasing goods online is quickly becoming a widely adopted practice.</p>



<p>So what does this mean for independent retailers?</p>



<p>Even before the coronavirus pandemic, the role of a physical storefront was in transition. No longer simply a channel for product distribution, retail outlets provide customers a chance to experience a product before purchasing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Behavioral data suggests consumers will continue to visit physical stores for expert advice, to socialize, and to test products.</p>



<p>This means retail marketers will have to learn new digital marketing strategies and tactics quickly to drive ecommerce sales. There are two main paths for customers to purchase products outside of a physical store:</p>



<ol><li>Direct to Consumer</li><li>Click and Collect</li></ol>



<p>We will examine each of these purchase models in the sections below.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Direct to Consumer Presents a Challenge</h2>



<p>Direct to consumer (also known as DTC or D2C) typically refers to companies who sell products directly to customers, bypassing third-party retailers, wholesalers, or any other middlemen. But some retailers have evolved their product delivery methods to offer direct shipping to consumers. But competing in this arena can pose significant challenges for independent retailers.</p>



<p>Consumers are accustomed to purchasing goods and services online through companies like Amazon. They’ve enjoyed personalized customer experiences built on complex platforms and technologies. Buyers also treat their personal information like currency. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/online-shopping-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">57% of online shoppers</a>&nbsp;feel comfortable providing personal information as long as it is to their benefit.</p>



<p>Retailers able to provide added value in the pre-purchase experience will be able to deal in this informational currency. Exceptional website user experience, high-value content, and an active presence on social media are examples of how marketers can position their brands as trustworthy and credible enough to online buyers.</p>



<p>More competition online has also increased ad costs on platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, which can inflate marketing spend if not managed effectively. It can be costly to learn the ins and outs of managing advertisements on these platforms. Independent retailers may consider outsourcing&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/services/ppc">paid media expertise</a>&nbsp;to platform specialists with access to content and creative resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecommerce digital marketing is very different than traditional retail marketing methods. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/direct-to-consumer-brands/#:~:text=Facebook%20Group-,The%20Rise%20Of%20Direct%20To,D2C)%20Brands%20%E2%80%93%20Statistics%20and%20Trends&amp;text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20over,to%2060%25%20of%20traditional%20retailers%20%3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half of consumers</a>&nbsp;would rather visit brand websites (rather than retail websites) because they offer more comprehensive information about their products. This means retailers looking to compete in this space may have to invest considerably in&nbsp;<a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/services/content-social">content marketing</a>&nbsp;to satisfy user demand for product information.</p>



<h2>Click-and-Collect Shows Growth Potential</h2>



<p>Click-and-collect refers to sales of products or services ordered online for pickup in a store, pickup hub location or via curbside pickup. According to the same eMarketer study, ‘click-and-collect’ sales in the US are projected to grow by more than 60% year-over-year in 2020.</p>



<p>There is no way to tell what lasting impact coronavirus will have on consumer behavior. But for some consumers, click-and-collect purchase methods may be the future of shopping.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-future-of-retail-what-2020-and-beyond-will-bring-to-the-industry/569615/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Retail Dive</a>, self-described ‘retail futurist’ and subject-matter expert Doug Stephens contends that “by as early as 2033 the majority of our daily consumption will be transacted online.”</p>



<p>Today’s shoppers regularly speak to Amazon’s Alexa and order products via a touchscreen device. The environment for this kind of ecommerce digital marketing strategy is ripe for retail marketers brave — and creative — enough to embrace the challenge.</p>



<p>However, consumer behavior varies widely by geography. In the United States alone, there have been noticeable differences in behavior in certain states. Variance in emergency mandates, community responses to the pandemic, and population density all contribute to these differences in behavior. Retailers who understand their own markets and buyer behavior will have an advantage when they build and execute their ecommerce digital marketing strategy.</p>



<h2>Creativity Remains Essential for Retail Marketers</h2>



<p>The edge conditions presented by the pandemic have forced marketers to get creative with their approach and adapt to this new consumer behavior — a perfect environment for innovation. Below are a few examples of independent retailers who were creative in their marketing approach.</p>



<p><a href="https://sleephappens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mattress Warehouse</a>&nbsp;went above and beyond to make their customers comfortable in their stores. Not only do employees provide masks, gloves, and maintain a 6ft distance within stores, but they also offer customers the option to&nbsp;<a href="https://sleephappens.com/pages/book-in-store-appointment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book an exclusive in-store appointment</a>. This kind of experience gives customers confidence and trust enough to make a purchase as significant as a mattress online.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sportsworldchicago.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports World</a>, an independent retailer located right across from Wrigley Field in Chicago, typically sees 40,000 fans on game days but in 2020 was forced to sell their sports memorabilia exclusively through their website. They used a combination of both direct-to-consumer and click-and-collect purchase methods. This activity kept the business alive during the critical months of the pandemic which would normally be the first half of a regular MLB season. Investing in these digital ecommerce channels positioned the store for an influx of online orders when there is more market demand for baseball.&nbsp;<a href="https://independentretailer.com/2020/05/12/retailer-learns-to-survive-the-shutdown-in-creative-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read the full story here.</a></p>



<h2>Ecommerce Digital Marketing Should Be Measured Differently</h2>



<p>Now more than ever, independent retailers must drive more sales with lower marketing budgets. It can be done, but to do so requires precise measurement and clear return on marketing investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Correlating advertising spend — be it traditional or digital — to in-store foot traffic and sales remains incredibly tough. It can be measured but requires a high level of ad spend. Even so, there is still no way to prove an ad actually caused a customer to make an in-store purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="/whitepaper/the-executive-guide-to-measuring-return-on-marketing-investment/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="http://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-701" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013-300x150.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013-768x384.png 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013-1536x768.png 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/return-on-marketing-investment_201008_115013.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>

<p>Marketing research is critical, especially for service providers. It can make or break your strategy. In this article you will read the story of an online journey that resulted in new business for a home construction company, and research that sheds light onto the customer journey at large.<br><br>I’m a millennial homeowner, married with three kids. For some home services marketers, I’d be their ideal customer. But I represent a shrinking demographic. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, being a homeowner puts me in the company of roughly 1 in 3 of my millennial peers under the age of 35, which is significantly lower than previous generations.</p>



<p>Traditional ways of reaching this demographic profile aren’t working as well as they have in the past — radio hits, sponsorships, and direct mail are a few examples of these dying tactics.</p>



<p>Other channels, like social media, are growing in popularity. In fact, <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/whitepaper/home-services-buyer-research/">our research study on buyers of home services</a> showed more than 93% of buyers were active on at least one social media platform. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/whitepaper/home-services-buyer-research/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1641" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog-cta-home-services-report.jpg 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>For me, my preferred social platforms are LinkedIn and Twitter. Even on these less popular platforms, I see a fair share of advertisements and promoted posts.</p>



<h2>Twitter, LeafFilter, and Acorn Bob</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://silverbackwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Acorn-Bob.png" alt="" class="wp-image-685" srcset="https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Acorn-Bob.png 800w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Acorn-Bob-300x225.png 300w, https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Acorn-Bob-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>My kids call the old oak tree by our house “Acorn Bob” because it drops thousands of acorns on our roof every September. They hit our roof with a THWACK that can be heard throughout the house. Cleaning out those gutters is a pain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One summer I saw a promoted Twitter post from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leaffilter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LeafFilter</a>&nbsp;about their gutter protection system. I watched the video, clicked through and booked an appointment. Ultimately I made the purchase.</p>



<p>Either it was purely coincidence, or they targeted the ad at my profile at the right time before the fall when I need gutter protection.</p>



<h4><a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/work/long-roofing">See also: How marketing alignment led the Mid-Atlantic’s leading roofing company to extraordinary growth.</a></h4>



<p>That’s why it pays to do marketing research *before* launching a campaign. Because if you understand your buyer, you can market to them better.</p>



<h2>What is marketing research?</h2>



<p>Marketing research is used to identify opportunities and threats that influence marketing. It is used to create buyer personas, develop key messages, brand and content strategies. It’s a strategic weapon that can focus your marketing messages to appeal to your ideal customer. </p>



<p>Research answers key questions, like:</p>



<p>Who is your target?<br>Why is there a need?<br>When are they active?<br>How do they make decisions?<br>What are their emotional triggers?<br>Where do they go online to find info?</p>



<p>These are just a sample of questions that can help you understand your buyers. <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/services/research/">Learn more about Silverback&#8217;s research services.</a></p>



<h2>1.&nbsp;Develop ideal customer profiles</h2>



<p>There are great customers. There are terrible customers. Marketing and sales activity should focus on attracting the customers you want more of, and disqualifying the customers you know are not worth your time.</p>



<p>Marketing research can help you understand the demographic profiles and behaviors that make up your ideal buyers.</p>



<p>This helps you develop buyer personas, or ideal customer profiles, which can be tools to focus messages and better qualify business opportunities. </p>



<h2>2. Refine brand differentiators</h2>



<p>A differentiator is what sets your home services company apart from competitors. It’s what makes your brand unique. If you can truly claim and prove an aspect of your service that is relevant and valuable to your targets, it can strengthen your brand and market position.</p>



<p>This is especially important for home construction companies. In our <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/whitepaper/home-services-buyer-research/">research on buyers of home services</a>, nearly 40% of home construction buyers had conversations with two separate service providers. This means focused marketing messages help buyers see what sets your business apart from the competition.</p>



<p>In the LeafFilter example, their differentiator is patented screen filter technology scientifically designed to keep everything out of your gutters — except for water. And it works.</p>



<p>With marketing research, you have an opportunity to uncover and refine brand differentiators. Some you might already know, but often this kind of research leads to new insights you haven’t considered before.</p>



<p>If you are losing out on price alone, it may be time to consider <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/services/research/">marketing research</a> to help distance your brand from other home service providers, making you more valuable to the right targets.</p>



<h2>3. Focus marketing messages</h2>



<p>Marketing research helps marketers understand the emotional triggers of target customers and what incites them to take action. This is critical to developing the right messages and offers to use.</p>



<p>Inconsistent messaging can be a brand killer, especially if you offer a service where the messages are conveyed through human-to-human interaction between customers and sales representatives or account managers. Marketing research can help provide structure to these messages and get your staff aligned with your brand.</p>



<p>After I had clicked on that Twitter ad and booked an appointment with LeafFilter, a sales rep came out and gave a demo of the screen technology in-person. Because I’m a marketer, I recognized his pitch sounded very similar to the ad. He amplified the pain of cleaning gutters, and even connected the dots to how an effective drainage system can protect my home from a number of things, including roofing damage, rotting wood, basement flooding and foundation cracks.</p>



<h2>4. Create compelling content</h2>



<p>Marketing research can also be used to understand the specific pain points and challenges of your ideal customers. By creating <a "https://www.silverbackstrategies.com/services/content-marketing/">content</a> that speaks to these pain points, your content instantly becomes more relevant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful content strategies require consistently publishing relevant thought leadership that speaks to your customer’s pain points. Doing this also has an impact on your company’s brand being seen as a trusted authority.</p>



<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t share one last LeafFilter example. They created this visually appealing and humorous &#8220;<a href="https://www.leaffilter.com/blog/clogged-gutters-flow-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clogged gutters flow chart</a>&#8221;&nbsp;that helps illustrate the value of their product in a fun way that resonates with the core challenges of why someone would need their product.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Poor marketing performance is often a symptom of a larger problem — companies simply do not understand their target customers as well as they should. Doing marketing research can lay the foundation for a successful, high-performance marketing engine that drives more qualified leads and ultimately more revenue.</p>



<p>Silverback Strategies offers <a href="/services/research/">research services</a>&nbsp;designed to understand your audience’s behavior to accelerate the performance of digital marketing campaigns.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s simple.</p>



<p>If you understand your buyers, you can market to them better.</p>
