										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="list-unstyled list-chevron">
<p>Emerging from the crazy year we’ve all experienced in 2020 has businesses around the globe scrambling to compete against one another in brand new ways. With more innovative technologies than ever on the horizon, it’s a good idea to stay on top of the business trends and developments that are sure to be big in 2021.In this article, we’ll discuss artificial intelligence (AI), <a href="/email-marketing/">email automation</a>, mobile marketing and much more. Keep reading to see what to expect in the upcoming year.</p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>One of the major business trends for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2020/01/02/top-12-business-trends-for-2020/#38c501ef2b59">2020</a> was the expansion of AI technology, and that will only grow in popularity in 2021. What was once thought to only be something out of a science fiction movie, AI is a key driver for companies as they seek to compete in the digital age. From <a href="/blog/use-chatbots-to-create-an-amazing-user-experience/">chatbots</a> to automated customer service, there isn’t much that an AI system can’t do.</p>
<p>Many businesses are using AI to respond to customer inquiries on social media platforms, emails and even phone calls. These aren’t just your average, run-of-the-mill chatbots anymore. Using behavioral tracking and data collection with analysis, these AI programs have become more intuitive in predicting where a conversation with a customer may go.</p>
<p>Trigger words that drive the conversation into a more complex discussion have been added to many AI programs. This means that customers are able to get answers quickly and efficiently without having to speak to a person.</p>
<p>For businesses, this is time- and money-saving. Instead of spending hours answering questions each day, turning this task over to an <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/341216">AI system</a> can be very freeing.</p>
<h2>Email Automation</h2>
<p>Another growing tech trend for businesses is <a href="https://www.business2community.com/email-marketing/6-email-marketing-trends-to-drive-more-sales-in-2020-02265825">email</a> automation. Yes, emails are still highly relevant and growing in popularity! In fact, interactive <a href="/features/email/">email campaigning</a> was one of the biggest marketing trends in 2020. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>61% of consumers want to receive emails from their favorite brands</li>
<li>59% of consumers are influenced by an email to make a purchase</li>
<li>49% of consumers want to receive weekly promotions and offers</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these factors point directly to email automation as a major business trend in 2021. With email automation, you can craft customized messages and schedule them to go to your recipient list without having to send them out one-by-one. This will save you and your marketing team a lot of time, and it will allow you to track the success rate of your email campaigns.</p>
<p>By utilizing email automation, you will be able to monitor the delivery, open, click-through and bounce rates of every message that goes out. This will enable you to tweak your email marketing strategy to suit your target audience better .</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for creating more <a href="/blog/sharpspring-guide-to-understanding-email-metrics/">effective emails</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it clean with a minimalist design style</li>
<li>Condense images and graphics for a faster email load speed</li>
<li>Include a clear call to action and make it the focus of the email</li>
<li>Personalize the messages to cater to your customers</li>
<li>Be sure that the messages are mobile-friendly</li>
<li>Make the email interactive to encourage engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>Interactive emails can help <a href="/blog/understanding-brand-voice-how-to-differentiate-and-amplify-your-messaging/">set your brand apart</a> from all the others. If you run an online clothing company, you can make your messages interactive by including a “Try On” feature. This allows the recipient to click through to a fun program that lets them virtually try on clothes before making a purchase. With its game-like qualities, the recipient will spend more time on your website clicking through your clothing selection. This boosts engagement and allows you to collect data about what styles this customer likes. You can then turn around and use that information to retarget them in later email campaigns.</p>
<h2>Mobile Marketing</h2>
<p>This trend plays into both AI technology and email automation. More people are opening emails on mobile devices than ever before. It’s a fast and easy way to comb through any promotions and keep up with the news. Increasingly, people are also using AI programs like their smart speakers on a daily basis. So, mobile marketing makes sense as one of the major business trends for 2021.</p>
<p>The first thing you can do to improve your <a href="https://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/5-small-business-trends-to-leverage-in-2020.html">mobile marketing efforts</a> is to begin accepting mobile payments from different platforms. This will eliminate the tedious step of inputting contact and payment information in order to make a purchase. Some potential customers may abandon their shopping cart if they can’t checkout quickly.</p>
<p>You can also create an app for your business. This will enable you to send out promotions and newsletters as well as gather important data about your customers. You can also incorporate a loyalty program in your app to encourage your customers to use it more often.</p>
<p>Automated text messaging is another form of mobile marketing. Once the customer agrees to receive text messages, you can send them announcements and promotions periodically. Just make sure that you don’t go overboard because they will unsubscribe if they feel annoyed by the number of texts they are receiving. One very simple way to get them to agree to text messaging is by offering a 10% discount to those who signup.</p>
<p>Finally, another advantage of mobile marketing is geo-targeting. This type of data collection allows you to send out targeted ads to people near your establishment.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up Business Trends for 2021</h2>
<p>With technology changing constantly, staying on top of trends can seem overwhelming. However, if you are clever in your usage of AI, email automation and mobile marketing, you will be light years ahead of many of your competitors.

<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more accessible for small businesses, many are turning to chatbots to improve user experience and automate communication with prospects. Google has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18169939/google-assistant-billion-devices-feature-phones-ces-2019">roughly 1 billion voice-enabled devices</a> in the market currently. That means one in seven people worldwide has likely interacted with a bot, whether they realize it or not. For business leaders, keeping up with the Joneses means staying on top of what Google is doing, and Google seems to like chatbots — a lot.</p>
<p>This segment is growing—and it&#8217;s growing fast! Yahoo Finance reports the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatbot-market-reach-usd-10-160542732.html">chatbot industry exceeded $1 billion</a> in 2018 and is expected to grow to over $10 billion by 2026. This tremendous growth is fueled by the many benefits that chatbots offer businesses as well as customers and prospects.</p>
<p>As it stands today, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/08/16/consumer-preference-for-chatbots-is-challenging-brands-to-think-bot-first/#5e719a3410f8">38 percent</a> of people say they prefer to speak with a bot compared with a real human being. One main benefit of utilizing bots for your online business is user experience. In the following blog, we’re going to talk all about chatbots, what they are and why they are important for better user experience (UX).</p>
<h3>What is a Chatbot?</h3>
<p>For a definition at face value, we need only to turn to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chatbot.asp">Investopedia</a>:</p>
<p>“A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging applications.”</p>
<h3>Chatbots and Value: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>The goal of this article is to chat (pun totally intended) about how chatbots enhance UX, but we can’t do that without also talking about the added value they bring — especially when combined with stellar human customer service efforts.</p>
<p>Here’s why <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-chatbots-are-critical-to-driving-enterprise-value-bf2087d2f308">chatbots and value</a> go hand-in-hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer support round the clock:</strong> Running a business ‘after hours’ can be costly; with chatbots, companies can provide support to customers 24/7/365. Being available whenever customers need assistance rather than just between the hours of nine to five is a major value-add and makes for happier customers and overall increased value.</li>
<li><strong>Get qualified leads:</strong> A chatbot can be programmed to receive all kinds of information. A chatbot can easily qualify a lead based on a few initial questions, ask for the individual’s email address once qualified and pass this information to a sales rep. This frees up <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/spend-less-time-scheduling-and-more-time-selling-with-sharpspring-meetings/">reps to do what they do best</a>, build relationships, close deals and win business.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbots allow for increased social listening:</strong> Reps who would normally spend all day on the phone fielding inbound calls in a call center can instead use <a href="https://sharpspring.com/features/sharpspring-social/">social listening tools</a>. This allows them to jump into organic conversations on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, answering customer questions where the conversations are happening naturally and increasing brand awareness in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chatbots and Customer Service</h3>
<p>In a world that’s highly digital, businesses big and small need to make sure customers feel like they’re a top priority. In the following section, we’ll look at the way chatbots improve customer service and user experience.</p>
<h3>Provide Seamlessness 24/7</h3>
<p>Chatbots provide a 24/7 seamless live chat experience. Unlike some tech solutions, there’s very little learning curve for customers to interact with chatbots. Chatbots are programmed to respond in a natural conversational way, making it incredibly easy for customers to get what they need. Chatbots can also be integrated into other company resources to submit referrals, alert management to issues, and log important data for the company.</p>
<p>Using chatbots is both a seamless and natural solution for companies, which can be working around the clock non-stop. Because chatbots can also be integrated with eCommerce sites, the customer journey also just got a little easier. They can pop up on product pages or at check out to offer customers more information about a product, or even additional discount incentives to buy now.</p>
<h3>Essential for Branding</h3>
<p>One especially valuable thing about chatbots is that they will act however you program them to act. Companies can design chatbots around their brand personality to ensure a cohesive impression for customers whether they interact with a human sales rep or a chatbot. Whether adding humor or charm, your chatbot can be as fun or straightforward as you want. Thinking about the tone of your chatbot’s personality is synonymous with thinking about your brand, mission and values, so make it count.</p>
<h3>Chatbots Relieve Customer Service Pressures</h3>
<p>This may come as a surprise, but many people do not enjoy making customer service calls. Hate is a strong word, but evidence strongly suggests <a href="http://customerthink.com/heres-why-most-people-hate-calling-tech-support-2/">people hate calling customer support</a>.</p>
<p>Technical problems, noisy backgrounds, social anxieties, confusion, jargon and overseas support reps can all contribute to the frustration on a customer service call. It’s no wonder why more people might prefer to work with a chatbot if it could better take care of their needs on the first attempt.</p>
<h3>Replace and Reinvent Outdated Tech</h3>
<p>People get frustrated by interactive voice response (IVR) menus that make customers wait through a long list of options. You’ve probably had it happen to you too, one faulty button press can cause the whole process to start over. And sometimes going through a drawn-out information gathering process to fill in some form with a customer service rep is another problem for customers who just want to get answers fast.</p>
<p>These are two examples of technology that can be reinvented using or replaced using chatbots. With a responsive chatbot that understands customer context, your customers will never have to wait through another IVR menu. Surveys can also be assessed through an engaging bot, rendering forms irrelevant in the data collection process.</p>
<h3>Better Digital Customer Service: Key to UX</h3>
<p>UX and customer service go together like, well, peanut butter and jelly, or bacon and eggs, or milk and cookies. (Is it lunchtime yet?) Anyway, you get the point&#8230;they go well together.</p>
<p>Focusing on UX means thinking about what ways you can better serve customers through your website and technology infrastructure&#8217;s design. Using chatbots <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/12/23/why-chatbots-could-be-the-secret-weapon-to-elevate-your-customer-experience/#70c1395d4645">positively changes your digital architecture</a> in a number of ways, including by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a platform for 24/7 support and intake</li>
<li>Infusing your brand and customer service values into your business technology infrastructure</li>
<li>Replacing technology that is no longer relevant or needed</li>
<li>Increasing productivity and encouraging efforts toward social listening</li>
<li>Automating otherwise manual processes like lead generation</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above actions help create a more focused customer service experience as well as a better user experience when customers interact with your brand online. There are some chatbot traits that can be optimized to make them even more useful (and fun!) tools for your company.</p>
<h3>Traits of Chatbots Optimized for UX</h3>
<p>A world leader in research-based user experience, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chatbots/">Neilsen Norman group recently explored</a> chatbot optimization for UX and noted the following key concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Interaction style:</strong> Businesses should include both a multiple-choice carousel of pre-decided links and buttons AND opportunities for customers to input sentences to tell their AI bot explicitly what they need. Links and buttons need to be clearly defined so users easily know to click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Menus and resource links:</strong> Uniquely, chatbots have the ability to offer up a number of choices to consumers, and that includes links to other resources. According to Nielsen Norman, this is best handled with menus and links included in the chat window when the context requires it.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations that guide:</strong> When it comes to chatbots, an unexpected query could throw a wrench in the whole thing, sometimes causing users to have to start back at the beginning of the conversation. This could negatively impact user experience, so bots must be optimized for more complex answer chains.</p>
<p><strong>Carousels:</strong> <a href="https://www.realnet.co.uk/news/carousel-sliders-good-practice-or-bad-for-seo">Carousels are contentious</a> in the world of digital products and SEO, but when it comes to chatbots they may be just what you need to offer comprehensive support. Using a slider underneath the chat window allows chat users to scroll through potential options, choosing what works best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong> This last one is actually <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/chatbots-and-their-benefits-for-user-experience-5660259274e7">not from Nielsen Norman research</a>, but we felt it was worth a mention. In a digital climate where big-box retailers are increasing in online revenue and decreasing in foot traffic, there’s little more important than offering personalization to customers. Chatbots support the vision of greater personalization by listening to customer’s specific needs and providing relevant solutions.</p>
<h3>Sharpspring: Experts on User Experience</h3>
<p>In combination with consistently strong human customer service efforts, chatbots offer an amazing opportunity for businesses. Not only do they save time, money and other resources when properly implemented, but they also create a unique customer journey. They can remove several frustration points in your process replacing them with something more natural and intuitive.</p>
