										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> will become more important than ever in 2020. A recent estimate from </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Statista</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> indicates that the number of online shoppers will grow to more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183755/number-of-us-internet-shoppers-since-2009/">230 million by 2021;</a> it&#8217;s vital to reflect the most recent trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in your mobile ux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For online businesses, it’s crucial to focus on user experience trends (also referred to as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trends)</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and maintain a mobile-friendly website in order to keep a high rank in search engine results pages (or SERPs) and generate higher conversion rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this article, we will go over some of the top mobile </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to stay on top of throughout 2020. </span></p>
<h3><b>Phasing Out the Button</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the release of the smartphone, buttons are becoming more and more a thing of the past. Mobile devices now have smooth touch screens without any sort of button to push. This design gives digital marketers more real estate to work with on the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A current </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> improves the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> by completely eliminating the use of buttons across mobile apps. Buttons can be replaced with gesture interactions which makes the content the center of attention. </span></p>
<h3><b>Bottom Navigation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the outdated button, small screens are also unlikely to be found on mobile devices in 2021 and beyond. Today’s larger touchscreen displays can load more information and are optimal for multitasking. However, with longer content to scroll through, it can be tedious to get back to the top of the page of poorly designed mobile sites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s where bottom navigation elements can come into play. Bottom sheets or cards featuring navigational elements can help make the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> much smoother. Instead of rummaging around trying to locate a certain feature or get back to the top of the page, the user can simply push the key element that corresponds with what they wish to do. </span></p>
<h3><b>Personalization</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One size no longer fits all. Mobile users want to see things that are catered specifically to them. This is where the growing trend towards personalization come in. According to a recent</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4481/personalized-marketing/">Statista</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400"> report, 90% of mobile users find content personalization very effective ㄧ with email campaigns being the leading type of personalization experience used by marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take </span><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Spotify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, for example. Using personal data and preferences, Spotify can customize the user’s interface to display songs that they might enjoy. It can even go as far as to suggest specific playlists and introduce the user to lesser known artists they might like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other personalization tactics you can use to improve </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> include geo-location, geo-fencing and behavioral profiling. </span></p>
<h3><b>Curves</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Modern mobile devices are sleek hand-held machines that feature curved edges lending a futuristic style. It only makes sense that your website or app would also begin to incorporate these curved elements into the mobile-friendly design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirroring curved corners gives the illusion of cohesiveness. It’s aesthetically pleasing and can go a long way in subconsciously making users feel at ease. This is because </span><a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/familiarity-memory-learning-2433/"><span style="font-weight: 400">familiarity makes information easier to process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<h3><b>Eliminating Passwords</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost everyone has forgotten or lost a password to an online account at some point in their lives. And recovering passwords can be annoying, arduous, stressful and can even lead to a loss in sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Consider this: if you are trying to make a purchase online and you can’t remember your password, how likely are you to go through the tedious process of recovering or resetting it? It depends on how much you want the product in question, but many users will simply exit the site and try somewhere else.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A top </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> currently is eliminating passwords and replacing them with some sort of biometric authentication method like a fingerprint or facial recognition. Other replacements for passwords can include time-sensitive sign-in links and one-time passwords. </span></p>
<h3><b>Functional Animation for Mobile UX</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a fun one that plays more on creativity. Dynamic movement and animations used in mobile-site transitions can be quite pleasing to users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can help you tell a story and present information in a smooth, seamless manner. Movie-like scenes can be used to confirm actions taken by the user or even add rhythm to the interactions taking place. It can even be considered part of your branding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to create a beautiful website or app that optimizes </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, then incorporating frame-to-frame advanced animations is a great way to go. </span></p>
<h3><b>3D Graphics</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to advanced animation, 3D graphics is another </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> that is coming in strong for 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in the day, it was mainly used for entertainment purposes. However, today we can use 3D graphics to enhance </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> by adding elements of realism to a digital site. For example, adding a virtual 3D tour of a home on a real estate app can help potential clients visualize the house better. </span></p>
<h3><b>Gradient Color Palettes</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s no secret that color plays a huge role in affecting human emotions. That’s why choosing the right colors for your brand is critical to growing your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smartphones, of course, don’t display in black and white. They display colors beautifully, so designers no longer have to create visuals in greyscale. Adding depth and dimension to mobile sites, color gradients are rapidly gaining popularity as a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trend</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. For example, using a gradient containing the gradual transition between vibrant hues can cultivate a feeling of warmth and positivity among users. </span></p>
<h3><b>Dark Mode</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the flip-side, incorporating a dark mode can also help to improve your site’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mobile user experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. By automatically adjusting the screen’s brightness to match the lighting environment, dark mode can reduce the strain on the user’s eyes and even help preserve battery life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People like to lay in bed at night and scroll. If you offer a dark mode option for them, they will most likely stay on your site longer. </span></p>
<h3><b>Enhanced Voice Interactions</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Voice interactions with mobile devices are becoming more commonplace every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adding a more conversational voice interaction interface to your mobile app or site can help reduce any bumps that may be inhibiting the UX. </span></p>
<h3><b>Wrapping Up: </b><b>Mobile User Experience</b><b> and </b><b>UX Trends</b><b> for 2021 and Beyond</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that you have learned about the current and upcoming </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, you can incorporate some of these elements into your mobile website or app to enhance the user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember to stay on top of changing trends to keep your customers happy and coming back for more. To learn more about </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UX trends</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and how they affect your </span><a href="/blog/7-ways-implement-omni-channel-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, you can read our </span><a href="/blog/4-ux-trends-to-transform-your-marketing-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="list-unstyled list-chevron">
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more accessible for small businesses, many are turning to chatbots to improve user experience and automate communication with prospects. Google has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18169939/google-assistant-billion-devices-feature-phones-ces-2019">roughly 1 billion voice-enabled devices</a> in the market currently. That means one in seven people worldwide has likely interacted with a bot, whether they realize it or not. For business leaders, keeping up with the Joneses means staying on top of what Google is doing, and Google seems to like chatbots — a lot.</p>
<p>This segment is growing—and it&#8217;s growing fast! Yahoo Finance reports the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatbot-market-reach-usd-10-160542732.html">chatbot industry exceeded $1 billion</a> in 2018 and is expected to grow to over $10 billion by 2026. This tremendous growth is fueled by the many benefits that chatbots offer businesses as well as customers and prospects.</p>
<p>As it stands today, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/08/16/consumer-preference-for-chatbots-is-challenging-brands-to-think-bot-first/#5e719a3410f8">38 percent</a> of people say they prefer to speak with a bot compared with a real human being. One main benefit of utilizing bots for your online business is user experience. In the following blog, we’re going to talk all about chatbots, what they are and why they are important for better user experience (UX).</p>
<h3>What is a Chatbot?</h3>
<p>For a definition at face value, we need only to turn to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chatbot.asp">Investopedia</a>:</p>
<p>“A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging applications.”</p>
<h3>Chatbots and Value: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>The goal of this article is to chat (pun totally intended) about how chatbots enhance UX, but we can’t do that without also talking about the added value they bring — especially when combined with stellar human customer service efforts.</p>
<p>Here’s why <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-chatbots-are-critical-to-driving-enterprise-value-bf2087d2f308">chatbots and value</a> go hand-in-hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer support round the clock:</strong> Running a business ‘after hours’ can be costly; with chatbots, companies can provide support to customers 24/7/365. Being available whenever customers need assistance rather than just between the hours of nine to five is a major value-add and makes for happier customers and overall increased value.</li>
<li><strong>Get qualified leads:</strong> A chatbot can be programmed to receive all kinds of information. A chatbot can easily qualify a lead based on a few initial questions, ask for the individual’s email address once qualified and pass this information to a sales rep. This frees up <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/spend-less-time-scheduling-and-more-time-selling-with-sharpspring-meetings/">reps to do what they do best</a>, build relationships, close deals and win business.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbots allow for increased social listening:</strong> Reps who would normally spend all day on the phone fielding inbound calls in a call center can instead use <a href="https://sharpspring.com/features/sharpspring-social/">social listening tools</a>. This allows them to jump into organic conversations on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, answering customer questions where the conversations are happening naturally and increasing brand awareness in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chatbots and Customer Service</h3>
<p>In a world that’s highly digital, businesses big and small need to make sure customers feel like they’re a top priority. In the following section, we’ll look at the way chatbots improve customer service and user experience.</p>
<h3>Provide Seamlessness 24/7</h3>
<p>Chatbots provide a 24/7 seamless live chat experience. Unlike some tech solutions, there’s very little learning curve for customers to interact with chatbots. Chatbots are programmed to respond in a natural conversational way, making it incredibly easy for customers to get what they need. Chatbots can also be integrated into other company resources to submit referrals, alert management to issues, and log important data for the company.</p>
<p>Using chatbots is both a seamless and natural solution for companies, which can be working around the clock non-stop. Because chatbots can also be integrated with eCommerce sites, the customer journey also just got a little easier. They can pop up on product pages or at check out to offer customers more information about a product, or even additional discount incentives to buy now.</p>
<h3>Essential for Branding</h3>
<p>One especially valuable thing about chatbots is that they will act however you program them to act. Companies can design chatbots around their brand personality to ensure a cohesive impression for customers whether they interact with a human sales rep or a chatbot. Whether adding humor or charm, your chatbot can be as fun or straightforward as you want. Thinking about the tone of your chatbot’s personality is synonymous with thinking about your brand, mission and values, so make it count.</p>
<h3>Chatbots Relieve Customer Service Pressures</h3>
<p>This may come as a surprise, but many people do not enjoy making customer service calls. Hate is a strong word, but evidence strongly suggests <a href="http://customerthink.com/heres-why-most-people-hate-calling-tech-support-2/">people hate calling customer support</a>.</p>
<p>Technical problems, noisy backgrounds, social anxieties, confusion, jargon and overseas support reps can all contribute to the frustration on a customer service call. It’s no wonder why more people might prefer to work with a chatbot if it could better take care of their needs on the first attempt.</p>
<h3>Replace and Reinvent Outdated Tech</h3>
<p>People get frustrated by interactive voice response (IVR) menus that make customers wait through a long list of options. You’ve probably had it happen to you too, one faulty button press can cause the whole process to start over. And sometimes going through a drawn-out information gathering process to fill in some form with a customer service rep is another problem for customers who just want to get answers fast.</p>
<p>These are two examples of technology that can be reinvented using or replaced using chatbots. With a responsive chatbot that understands customer context, your customers will never have to wait through another IVR menu. Surveys can also be assessed through an engaging bot, rendering forms irrelevant in the data collection process.</p>
<h3>Better Digital Customer Service: Key to UX</h3>
<p>UX and customer service go together like, well, peanut butter and jelly, or bacon and eggs, or milk and cookies. (Is it lunchtime yet?) Anyway, you get the point&#8230;they go well together.</p>
<p>Focusing on UX means thinking about what ways you can better serve customers through your website and technology infrastructure&#8217;s design. Using chatbots <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/12/23/why-chatbots-could-be-the-secret-weapon-to-elevate-your-customer-experience/#70c1395d4645">positively changes your digital architecture</a> in a number of ways, including by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a platform for 24/7 support and intake</li>
<li>Infusing your brand and customer service values into your business technology infrastructure</li>
<li>Replacing technology that is no longer relevant or needed</li>
<li>Increasing productivity and encouraging efforts toward social listening</li>
<li>Automating otherwise manual processes like lead generation</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above actions help create a more focused customer service experience as well as a better user experience when customers interact with your brand online. There are some chatbot traits that can be optimized to make them even more useful (and fun!) tools for your company.</p>
<h3>Traits of Chatbots Optimized for UX</h3>
<p>A world leader in research-based user experience, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chatbots/">Neilsen Norman group recently explored</a> chatbot optimization for UX and noted the following key concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Interaction style:</strong> Businesses should include both a multiple-choice carousel of pre-decided links and buttons AND opportunities for customers to input sentences to tell their AI bot explicitly what they need. Links and buttons need to be clearly defined so users easily know to click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Menus and resource links:</strong> Uniquely, chatbots have the ability to offer up a number of choices to consumers, and that includes links to other resources. According to Nielsen Norman, this is best handled with menus and links included in the chat window when the context requires it.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations that guide:</strong> When it comes to chatbots, an unexpected query could throw a wrench in the whole thing, sometimes causing users to have to start back at the beginning of the conversation. This could negatively impact user experience, so bots must be optimized for more complex answer chains.</p>
<p><strong>Carousels:</strong> <a href="https://www.realnet.co.uk/news/carousel-sliders-good-practice-or-bad-for-seo">Carousels are contentious</a> in the world of digital products and SEO, but when it comes to chatbots they may be just what you need to offer comprehensive support. Using a slider underneath the chat window allows chat users to scroll through potential options, choosing what works best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong> This last one is actually <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/chatbots-and-their-benefits-for-user-experience-5660259274e7">not from Nielsen Norman research</a>, but we felt it was worth a mention. In a digital climate where big-box retailers are increasing in online revenue and decreasing in foot traffic, there’s little more important than offering personalization to customers. Chatbots support the vision of greater personalization by listening to customer’s specific needs and providing relevant solutions.</p>
