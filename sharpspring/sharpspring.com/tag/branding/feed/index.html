<p>It sounds obvious, but there is a lot more to developing an effective brand strategy than simply designing a logo and posting on social media now and then. True brand development is crucial for your company to not just survive but thrive in today’s business landscape.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll walk you through the basics of how to build your brand and set your business up for success in a saturated marketplace.</p>
<h2>Brand Development Strategy</h2>
<p>What exactly is brand strategy? It’s the vital first step of brand building – a long-term plan for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2019/12/13/4-branding-strategies-2020/#299b9ca6750b">business development</a> designed to help you reach your specific goals. If you want to learn how to build your brand, you absolutely need to begin with a strategy.</p>
<p>Here are a few helpful tips when it comes to brand strategy:</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Know Your Audience</h3>
<p>Before you can implement a successful brand marketing strategy, you must know your audience inside and out. Start by creating a <a href="/persona-development/">buyer persona</a> that represents your ideal client. You can go into detail with this fictional representation, adding notes such as income level, career and pain points. The best part about buyer personas is that you can always add more characteristics after you’ve run a few campaigns and collected <a href="/blog/use-data-marketing/">valuable customer insights</a>.</p>
<h3>Tip #2: Take a Stand</h3>
<p>Now that you know your target market, you can begin the process of building a brand strategy by taking a stand for something that is important to you, your business and your target audience. A mission statement with a purpose sets you apart from your competitors – and gives your intended audience a reason to choose your company.</p>
<h3>Tip #3: Design Stellar Brand Packaging</h3>
<p>Your brand’s name, logo and tagline are critical to making a great first impression. Be sure to put a lot of thought into the aesthetics of your website. Try thinking of it as a presentation: When a new visitor comes to your website, what kind of impression do you want them to have?</p>
<p>Taking the time to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/12/23/five-strategies-for-developing-a-strong-brand-identity/#6ebe3862a76b">develop your branding package</a> will ensure that your company is resonating with the right audience.</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Build a Dynamic Website</h3>
<p>The next part of brand development is the website. Now that you understand your audience, have a killer mission statement and have chosen your brand package, you can begin <a href="/activity/fast-easy-ways-to-increase-website-traffic-part-1/">building a dynamic website</a> based on all of these aspects. If your company is new, small or has a tight budget, you can find great website-building sites that offer affordable, professional results.</p>
<p>Remember to organize your site thoughtfully &#8212; build personalized landing pages based on your buyer personas, add dynamic web forms and include CTAs where appropriate.</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Don’t Slack on Content Marketing</h3>
<p>A solid <a href="/utilizing-content-marketing-solutions/">content marketing strategy</a> will go a long way in helping you build your brand strategy. The first way to initiate content marketing is to create a blog on your website and publish thoughtful, relevant articles that your audience will find useful. You can also generate a content calendar to help you keep track of what you post, when you post it and how well the content is received.</p>
<h3>Tip #6: Build Up Your Social Media Following</h3>
<p>Good brand building also involves a strong <a href="/blog/stand-out-social-media/">social media presence</a>. If you haven’t created social business accounts yet, it’s time to get started. This ties back into knowing your audience and where they congregate online. It lets you expand your online presence, share your blog posts and fully establish your company as a thought leader in your industry or niche. Keep in mind that a strong <a href="https://marketingland.com/social-media-2020-the-top-features-formats-and-trends-to-get-familiar-with-this-year-273367">social media following</a> doesn’t necessarily mean that you need a million followers – it means that you have an active and engaged online community.</p>
<h3>Tip #7: Track Your Efforts</h3>
<p>Once you’ve initiated and implemented your brand strategy, you need to track the progress of your efforts, analyze your findings and generate easy-to-read reports for better understanding. You can track website visits, social shares and everything in between.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>To wrap up, a brand strategy is designed to help your business reach your goals. While it may be a long-term plan, you aren’t limited to striving for long-term goals – you can always wrap short-term goals into your efforts, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems that social media platforms are constantly coming out with new features that their top users can&#8217;t get enough of. These features also provide new opportunities for businesses to reach their audiences and engage with them in fun, unique ways. Instagram Stories is just one example of an underutilized feature that businesses should be using to their advantage. However, many people aren&#8217;t sure how to go about using Instagram Stories to boost business and help bring positive attention and increased awareness to their brand. That&#8217;s where we come in!</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know to get started using Instagram Stories for your business:</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Use Instagram Stories</span></h2>
<p>If you use Instagram, you’ve probably noticed the &#8220;Stories” section that appears at the top of the app:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181823" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94o0RBY1qm4rc3_540.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="810" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94o0RBY1qm4rc3_540.jpg 466w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94o0RBY1qm4rc3_540-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /><br />
Click on a Story, and you’re taken to a series of short videos shared by the account holder. But Stories are not just for individuals to create! Designing engaging Instagram Stories for your business is a great way to gain more visibility on the platform.</p>
<p>Instagram is constantly updating its app, and it can be tough to keep up and remain in-the-know about all the features. Here’s a brief overview of how to use Instagram Stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can launch stories by swiping right from the main Instagram screen, or by clicking the camera button.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-181822 size-large" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screenshot_20190129-180018-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screenshot_20190129-180018-576x1024.png 576w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screenshot_20190129-180018-169x300.png 169w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screenshot_20190129-180018.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you use Snapchat, then Stories will look familiar. Just tap the circle button to take a photo, or press and hold to record a video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181824" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94ofmhA1qm4rc3_540.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="810" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94ofmhA1qm4rc3_540.jpg 466w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94ofmhA1qm4rc3_540-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you can also upload photos and videos from your gallery. Just tap the photo icon that appears on the left side of your screen.</li>
<li>Once you’ve selected the photo or video you want, you can edit it by adding text or drawings. There are different kinds of pens and editing features you can use to customize your Story.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181825" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94oMV2z1qm4rc3_540.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="810" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94oMV2z1qm4rc3_540.jpg 466w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tumblr_inline_p7h94oMV2z1qm4rc3_540-173x300.jpg 173w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>When you’re finished editing, simply tap Done. Next click the Add Your Story button to share it with your audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>But that’s just one part of your Story. People and brands who use this feature create a series of short clips that play in sequence and disappear after 24-hours. To add to your story, just keep following the steps above and it will automatically appear with the other clips from the day.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips for Creating Great Instagram Stories for Your Brand</span></h2>
<p>Instagram Stories has lots of cool features that can help you create engaging content. Here&#8217;s a few quick tips for creating Stories that catch people&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3>1. Create Boomerangs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/11948231/Instagram-launches-gif-like-app-Boomerang.html">Boomerangs</a> are short videos that play backward and forward. They’re a great content type if you’re capturing something really interesting that people want to see on repeat. Instagram allows you to create and upload Boomerangs right to your Story.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181816" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boomerang_3480098b.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="387" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boomerang_3480098b.jpg 620w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/boomerang_3480098b-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>To create a Boomerang, swipe right from your Instagram feed. Then below the record button, you’ll see an option to toggle over to Boomerang mode.</p>
<h3>2. Stream Live Events</h3>
<p>Stories has an option to create live videos as well, much like Facebook Live. This is a great feature for businesses that are trying to create an authentic relationship with their audiences. Once you open your Stories camera, you’ll see an option to record live. Once you start, a Live tag will appear over your Instagram Stories bubble to let people know that you’re recording live. Instagram may also notify some of your followers directly.</p>
<p>If you create a great live video, then you can press the Share button and share it to your story for the next 24 hours, just like a regular video.</p>
<h3>3. Use Links</h3>
<p>If you have a business Instagram account with more than 10 thousand followers, then you get access to extra features that can help you drive traffic from your Instagram Stories. One of them is the ability to include links in your Stories. When someone views your Story and swipes up, it will redirect them wherever your link goes.</p>
<p>So you can redirect your audiences to specific landing pages, incorporating Stories directly into your sales funnel.</p>
<h3>4. Share Polls</h3>
<p>Another cool feature of Instagram Stories is the ability to <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/instagram-stories-polls-how-to-use/">share polls</a> with your audience. This is a great way to engage followers as well as learn more about them.</p>
<p>To do a poll, create a story post and then tap the Sticker icon at the top of the Story screen. You’ll see an option to create a Poll sticker. Click that, then follow the instructions to create a poll to go with your story.</p>
<p>Polls can inform your audience, build suspense, or help you understand more about them:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181819" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-popup.png" alt="" width="300" height="533" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-popup.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-popup-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>You can also ask your audience to comment to get even more feedback:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181818" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-ask-for-feedback.png" alt="" width="300" height="533" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-ask-for-feedback.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jh-instagram-poll-ask-for-feedback-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>5. Tag Other Accounts</h3>
<p>Tagging other accounts is a great way to encourage more engagement from your Instagram Stories. This is a great feature to use when you’re collaborating with influencers or other businesses on a social media campaign.</p>
<p>Whenever you mention someone in your story, they’ll receive a private message notifying them. So it’s an easy way to capture the attention of your brand advocates and influencers.</p>
<h3>6. Be a Friend</h3>
<p>Instagram users love to watch Stories their friends post of their experiences and new things they’re trying out. If your goal is to build a relationship with your audience on social media, then blending in with the rest of their friends is a great strategy to take.</p>
<p><a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-stories-best-brands-examples-to-copy/">Glossier</a> is an example of a brand that does this well. They like to demo their products with real people and offer makeup advice:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181820" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pjimage-3-1024x778.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="778" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pjimage-3-1024x778.jpg 1024w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pjimage-3-1024x778-300x228.jpg 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pjimage-3-1024x778-768x584.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>They also avoid using fancy graphics or professional photography with their Stories to make them feel like posts from a friend, not a brand.</p>
<h3>7. Engage Your Brand Advocates</h3>
<p>People follow your brand on Instagram because they like you and your products. Instagram Stories are a great opportunity to engage them and turn them into brand advocates. For example, you can use Stories to announce a special promotion or giveaway.</p>
<p><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/creative-instagram-stories/">Pacific Northwest Wonderland</a> does this with their sticker promotions:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181817" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/creative-instagram-stories-pnwonderland-576x1024.png" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/creative-instagram-stories-pnwonderland-576x1024.png 576w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/creative-instagram-stories-pnwonderland-576x1024-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep Up With the Trends </span></h2>
<p>Instagram Stories is a powerful tool for brands who want to reach, engage, and drive conversions from their audience. But the platform is constantly changing. New features are always coming out that change the ways you can interact with your audience. Keep up with the latest features and trends in how people are using Instagram Stories and you&#8217;ll ensure your brand is always ahead of the curve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="list-unstyled list-chevron">
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more accessible for small businesses, many are turning to chatbots to improve user experience and automate communication with prospects. Google has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18169939/google-assistant-billion-devices-feature-phones-ces-2019">roughly 1 billion voice-enabled devices</a> in the market currently. That means one in seven people worldwide has likely interacted with a bot, whether they realize it or not. For business leaders, keeping up with the Joneses means staying on top of what Google is doing, and Google seems to like chatbots — a lot.</p>
<p>This segment is growing—and it&#8217;s growing fast! Yahoo Finance reports the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatbot-market-reach-usd-10-160542732.html">chatbot industry exceeded $1 billion</a> in 2018 and is expected to grow to over $10 billion by 2026. This tremendous growth is fueled by the many benefits that chatbots offer businesses as well as customers and prospects.</p>
<p>As it stands today, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/08/16/consumer-preference-for-chatbots-is-challenging-brands-to-think-bot-first/#5e719a3410f8">38 percent</a> of people say they prefer to speak with a bot compared with a real human being. One main benefit of utilizing bots for your online business is user experience. In the following blog, we’re going to talk all about chatbots, what they are and why they are important for better user experience (UX).</p>
<h3>What is a Chatbot?</h3>
<p>For a definition at face value, we need only to turn to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chatbot.asp">Investopedia</a>:</p>
<p>“A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging applications.”</p>
<h3>Chatbots and Value: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>The goal of this article is to chat (pun totally intended) about how chatbots enhance UX, but we can’t do that without also talking about the added value they bring — especially when combined with stellar human customer service efforts.</p>
<p>Here’s why <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-chatbots-are-critical-to-driving-enterprise-value-bf2087d2f308">chatbots and value</a> go hand-in-hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer support round the clock:</strong> Running a business ‘after hours’ can be costly; with chatbots, companies can provide support to customers 24/7/365. Being available whenever customers need assistance rather than just between the hours of nine to five is a major value-add and makes for happier customers and overall increased value.</li>
<li><strong>Get qualified leads:</strong> A chatbot can be programmed to receive all kinds of information. A chatbot can easily qualify a lead based on a few initial questions, ask for the individual’s email address once qualified and pass this information to a sales rep. This frees up <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/spend-less-time-scheduling-and-more-time-selling-with-sharpspring-meetings/">reps to do what they do best</a>, build relationships, close deals and win business.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbots allow for increased social listening:</strong> Reps who would normally spend all day on the phone fielding inbound calls in a call center can instead use <a href="https://sharpspring.com/features/sharpspring-social/">social listening tools</a>. This allows them to jump into organic conversations on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, answering customer questions where the conversations are happening naturally and increasing brand awareness in the process.</li>

<h3>Chatbots and Customer Service</h3>
<p>In a world that’s highly digital, businesses big and small need to make sure customers feel like they’re a top priority. In the following section, we’ll look at the way chatbots improve customer service and user experience.</p>
<h3>Provide Seamlessness 24/7</h3>
<p>Chatbots provide a 24/7 seamless live chat experience. Unlike some tech solutions, there’s very little learning curve for customers to interact with chatbots. Chatbots are programmed to respond in a natural conversational way, making it incredibly easy for customers to get what they need. Chatbots can also be integrated into other company resources to submit referrals, alert management to issues, and log important data for the company.</p>
<p>Using chatbots is both a seamless and natural solution for companies, which can be working around the clock non-stop. Because chatbots can also be integrated with eCommerce sites, the customer journey also just got a little easier. They can pop up on product pages or at check out to offer customers more information about a product, or even additional discount incentives to buy now.</p>
<h3>Essential for Branding</h3>
<p>One especially valuable thing about chatbots is that they will act however you program them to act. Companies can design chatbots around their brand personality to ensure a cohesive impression for customers whether they interact with a human sales rep or a chatbot. Whether adding humor or charm, your chatbot can be as fun or straightforward as you want. Thinking about the tone of your chatbot’s personality is synonymous with thinking about your brand, mission and values, so make it count.</p>
<h3>Chatbots Relieve Customer Service Pressures</h3>
<p>This may come as a surprise, but many people do not enjoy making customer service calls. Hate is a strong word, but evidence strongly suggests <a href="http://customerthink.com/heres-why-most-people-hate-calling-tech-support-2/">people hate calling customer support</a>.</p>
<p>Technical problems, noisy backgrounds, social anxieties, confusion, jargon and overseas support reps can all contribute to the frustration on a customer service call. It’s no wonder why more people might prefer to work with a chatbot if it could better take care of their needs on the first attempt.</p>
<h3>Replace and Reinvent Outdated Tech</h3>
<p>People get frustrated by interactive voice response (IVR) menus that make customers wait through a long list of options. You’ve probably had it happen to you too, one faulty button press can cause the whole process to start over. And sometimes going through a drawn-out information gathering process to fill in some form with a customer service rep is another problem for customers who just want to get answers fast.</p>
<p>These are two examples of technology that can be reinvented using or replaced using chatbots. With a responsive chatbot that understands customer context, your customers will never have to wait through another IVR menu. Surveys can also be assessed through an engaging bot, rendering forms irrelevant in the data collection process.</p>
<h3>Better Digital Customer Service: Key to UX</h3>
<p>UX and customer service go together like, well, peanut butter and jelly, or bacon and eggs, or milk and cookies. (Is it lunchtime yet?) Anyway, you get the point&#8230;they go well together.</p>
<p>Focusing on UX means thinking about what ways you can better serve customers through your website and technology infrastructure&#8217;s design. Using chatbots <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/12/23/why-chatbots-could-be-the-secret-weapon-to-elevate-your-customer-experience/#70c1395d4645">positively changes your digital architecture</a> in a number of ways, including by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a platform for 24/7 support and intake</li>
<li>Infusing your brand and customer service values into your business technology infrastructure</li>
<li>Replacing technology that is no longer relevant or needed</li>
<li>Increasing productivity and encouraging efforts toward social listening</li>
<li>Automating otherwise manual processes like lead generation</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above actions help create a more focused customer service experience as well as a better user experience when customers interact with your brand online. There are some chatbot traits that can be optimized to make them even more useful (and fun!) tools for your company.</p>
<h3>Traits of Chatbots Optimized for UX</h3>
<p>A world leader in research-based user experience, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chatbots/">Neilsen Norman group recently explored</a> chatbot optimization for UX and noted the following key concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Interaction style:</strong> Businesses should include both a multiple-choice carousel of pre-decided links and buttons AND opportunities for customers to input sentences to tell their AI bot explicitly what they need. Links and buttons need to be clearly defined so users easily know to click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Menus and resource links:</strong> Uniquely, chatbots have the ability to offer up a number of choices to consumers, and that includes links to other resources. According to Nielsen Norman, this is best handled with menus and links included in the chat window when the context requires it.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations that guide:</strong> When it comes to chatbots, an unexpected query could throw a wrench in the whole thing, sometimes causing users to have to start back at the beginning of the conversation. This could negatively impact user experience, so bots must be optimized for more complex answer chains.</p>
<p><strong>Carousels:</strong> <a href="https://www.realnet.co.uk/news/carousel-sliders-good-practice-or-bad-for-seo">Carousels are contentious</a> in the world of digital products and SEO, but when it comes to chatbots they may be just what you need to offer comprehensive support. Using a slider underneath the chat window allows chat users to scroll through potential options, choosing what works best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong> This last one is actually <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/chatbots-and-their-benefits-for-user-experience-5660259274e7">not from Nielsen Norman research</a>, but we felt it was worth a mention. In a digital climate where big-box retailers are increasing in online revenue and decreasing in foot traffic, there’s little more important than offering personalization to customers. Chatbots support the vision of greater personalization by listening to customer’s specific needs and providing relevant solutions.</p>
