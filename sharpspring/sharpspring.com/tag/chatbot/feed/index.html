<p>Your customers want answers now, but you need to focus on delivering great products and services. Answering the same questions again and again simply isn’t the best use of your time. That’s where chatbots come in.</p>
<p>Automating one-on-one conversations between you and your audience, chatbots have the power to convert anonymous traffic into warm leads around the clock. Once you’re <a href="https://help.sharpspring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035747891-Creating-Chatbots">set up</a>, it’s simple to use chatbots to create an amazing user experience and provide relevant and timely engagement with site visitors — without the steep time investment of more traditional methods like phone and email.</p>
<h2>Chatbots Come in Two Main Types:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 500;">Rules-Based: </span>Rules-based bots offer standardized responses and funnel users through a “tree” of questions.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 500;">AI: </span>AI bots conduct basic conversations in natural language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of type, a well-placed chatbot can redefine the user experience (UX) on your site, transforming any static page into a dynamic 2-way communication channel with your brand. Chatbots automate and personalize the sales cycle for your leads while freeing up your team to handle more important business.</p>
<p>Combined with stellar communication and customer service, chatbots can help boost business productivity while making clients happier than ever. And when you have access to powerful marketing and sales automation functionality like SharpSpring, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Here are some innovative ways to use chatbots for your business.</p>
<h2>Offer a Personalized User Experience on Your Website</h2>
<p>It’s common practice in ecommerce to upsell related products to customers who make purchases on your site. In brick-and-mortar retail stores, it’s hard to ignore the magazine covers and colorful candy-wrappers lining the aisles, too. Chatbots can be embedded on any page of your site to even greater effect. For example, when a site visitor checks your product page for <a href="/features/email/">email marketing</a> services, a well-placed chatbot can offer assistance and slide in a conversational upsell on the benefits of integrating with a powerful <a href="/features/crm/">CRM</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-199146" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chatbots_R2-300x222.png" alt="Chatbot Example Image" width="553" height="409" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chatbots_R2-300x222.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chatbots_R2.png 572w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" /></p>
<p>Responses and recommendations can get much more specific based on how people engage with your chatbots. Sophisticated chatbots can easily secure lead information from your visitors and even opt them into your email sends without a form-fill. People appreciate feeling like your brand caters to their individual needs, so being able to opt-in by simply answering “yes” to a chatbot instead of filling out a form can make the difference between apathy and a conversion.</p>
<p>There’s no need to stop at product recommendations, though. Chatbots can consult with leads or customers about their needs and offer personalized solutions. Perhaps the user knows they’ll need email marketing but aren’t sure exactly why. They visit your email marketing page where your chatbot provides valuable information to sell the benefits and drive them closer to a conversion. You’ve automated lead nurturing, while further cementing the presence of your brand with your audience.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, chatbots are increasingly able to offer highly specialized recommendations and advice. Essentially, your chatbot could serve as a true digital assistant that can capture users’ needs, questions, and preferences, help you define your target personas and provide information that’s fully personalized for each user.</p>
<p>Using the SharpSpring platform, you can now create chatbots to provide automatic support for specific questions your web visitors have. You can find out more about getting started with chatbots <a href="https://help.sharpspring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035747891-Creating-Chatbots">here</a>, or simply reach out to your account manager for details.</p>
<h2>Use Chatbots to Gather User Data and Improve UX</h2>
<p>The best way to verify that your chatbots are improving user experience on your site is to obtain user feedback. Your customers want to spend less time taking surveys and more time learning about your products and services. <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/299611">Use chatbots to gather feedback</a> in the natural flow of conversion for quick, unobtrusive data collection. Getting this right is crucial to optimizing your marketing strategy.</p>
<p>For example, instead of sending your users to a survey page after someone completes a purchase, have a bot capture their attention at the end of the sales cycle. Bonus points if the bot is able to stay with the customer throughout the entire sales process.</p>
<p>Keep the chatbot “survey” simple and brief. Instead of having customers rate their experience on a scale of 1-to-10, try being more conversational with  questions like, “What did you like best about our website?” or “How can we make things easier for you next time?”</p>
<h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p>SharSpring&#8217;s chatbot launched in 2020, and we offer an in-depth <a href="https://vimeo.com/411531940/cf600ccb5c">Case Study video</a> featuring Tom Berry, the Founder and Managing Director of SharpSpring partner agency Autus Consulting, who emphasizes the effectiveness of chatbot personalization and audience segmentation, as well as the importance of allowing your chatbot to reflect your company&#8217;s own brand and personality. Check out the full Case Study in <a href="https://vimeo.com/411531940/cf600ccb5c">this video</a> from our SharpSpring at Work series.</p>
<p>Another useful chatbot Case Study to check out if from Landbot.io. They also feature chatbots and <a href="https://landbot.io/blog/best-chatbot-examples/">their site uses chatbots to their advantage</a>. At the bottom of every article on their blog, a bot asks for the reader’s feedback on the article. It’s simple, attractive, and keeps engagement streamlined to two questions: “Did you enjoy this article” and then, “How would you rate this article?”. The chatbot responds to your rating with a funny GIF, then asks you if you’d like to sign up for the newsletter or get started with their service — or both.</p>
<p>This bot is a three-in-one: it gathers feedback, collects user information and nurtures leads. Plus, it’s cute and enjoyable to use.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Chatbots can drastically improve the immersive aspect, scope and quality of the user experience on your site. To maximize success, make sure your chatbots reflect company values and consistently express the key messaging associated with your sales and marketing strategy. People appreciate unique, personalized and fun buying experiences, so aim to provide that with your chatbots. Consider common problems and issues people might encounter on their way to conversion and design your chatbots to bridge those gaps and nurture leads through your sales process. With these best practices in mind, you’ll be well on your way to revolutionary results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="list-unstyled list-chevron">
<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more accessible for small businesses, many are turning to chatbots to improve user experience and automate communication with prospects. Google has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18169939/google-assistant-billion-devices-feature-phones-ces-2019">roughly 1 billion voice-enabled devices</a> in the market currently. That means one in seven people worldwide has likely interacted with a bot, whether they realize it or not. For business leaders, keeping up with the Joneses means staying on top of what Google is doing, and Google seems to like chatbots — a lot.</p>
<p>This segment is growing—and it&#8217;s growing fast! Yahoo Finance reports the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatbot-market-reach-usd-10-160542732.html">chatbot industry exceeded $1 billion</a> in 2018 and is expected to grow to over $10 billion by 2026. This tremendous growth is fueled by the many benefits that chatbots offer businesses as well as customers and prospects.</p>
<p>As it stands today, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2019/08/16/consumer-preference-for-chatbots-is-challenging-brands-to-think-bot-first/#5e719a3410f8">38 percent</a> of people say they prefer to speak with a bot compared with a real human being. One main benefit of utilizing bots for your online business is user experience. In the following blog, we’re going to talk all about chatbots, what they are and why they are important for better user experience (UX).</p>
<h3>What is a Chatbot?</h3>
<p>For a definition at face value, we need only to turn to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chatbot.asp">Investopedia</a>:</p>
<p>“A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging applications.”</p>
<h3>Chatbots and Value: A Perfect Match</h3>
<p>The goal of this article is to chat (pun totally intended) about how chatbots enhance UX, but we can’t do that without also talking about the added value they bring — especially when combined with stellar human customer service efforts.</p>
<p>Here’s why <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-chatbots-are-critical-to-driving-enterprise-value-bf2087d2f308">chatbots and value</a> go hand-in-hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer support round the clock:</strong> Running a business ‘after hours’ can be costly; with chatbots, companies can provide support to customers 24/7/365. Being available whenever customers need assistance rather than just between the hours of nine to five is a major value-add and makes for happier customers and overall increased value.</li>
<li><strong>Get qualified leads:</strong> A chatbot can be programmed to receive all kinds of information. A chatbot can easily qualify a lead based on a few initial questions, ask for the individual’s email address once qualified and pass this information to a sales rep. This frees up <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/spend-less-time-scheduling-and-more-time-selling-with-sharpspring-meetings/">reps to do what they do best</a>, build relationships, close deals and win business.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbots allow for increased social listening:</strong> Reps who would normally spend all day on the phone fielding inbound calls in a call center can instead use <a href="https://sharpspring.com/features/sharpspring-social/">social listening tools</a>. This allows them to jump into organic conversations on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, answering customer questions where the conversations are happening naturally and increasing brand awareness in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chatbots and Customer Service</h3>
<p>In a world that’s highly digital, businesses big and small need to make sure customers feel like they’re a top priority. In the following section, we’ll look at the way chatbots improve customer service and user experience.</p>
<h3>Provide Seamlessness 24/7</h3>
<p>Chatbots provide a 24/7 seamless live chat experience. Unlike some tech solutions, there’s very little learning curve for customers to interact with chatbots. Chatbots are programmed to respond in a natural conversational way, making it incredibly easy for customers to get what they need. Chatbots can also be integrated into other company resources to submit referrals, alert management to issues, and log important data for the company.</p>
<p>Using chatbots is both a seamless and natural solution for companies, which can be working around the clock non-stop. Because chatbots can also be integrated with eCommerce sites, the customer journey also just got a little easier. They can pop up on product pages or at check out to offer customers more information about a product, or even additional discount incentives to buy now.</p>
<h3>Essential for Branding</h3>
<p>One especially valuable thing about chatbots is that they will act however you program them to act. Companies can design chatbots around their brand personality to ensure a cohesive impression for customers whether they interact with a human sales rep or a chatbot. Whether adding humor or charm, your chatbot can be as fun or straightforward as you want. Thinking about the tone of your chatbot’s personality is synonymous with thinking about your brand, mission and values, so make it count.</p>
<h3>Chatbots Relieve Customer Service Pressures</h3>
<p>This may come as a surprise, but many people do not enjoy making customer service calls. Hate is a strong word, but evidence strongly suggests <a href="http://customerthink.com/heres-why-most-people-hate-calling-tech-support-2/">people hate calling customer support</a>.</p>
<p>Technical problems, noisy backgrounds, social anxieties, confusion, jargon and overseas support reps can all contribute to the frustration on a customer service call. It’s no wonder why more people might prefer to work with a chatbot if it could better take care of their needs on the first attempt.</p>
<h3>Replace and Reinvent Outdated Tech</h3>
<p>People get frustrated by interactive voice response (IVR) menus that make customers wait through a long list of options. You’ve probably had it happen to you too, one faulty button press can cause the whole process to start over. And sometimes going through a drawn-out information gathering process to fill in some form with a customer service rep is another problem for customers who just want to get answers fast.</p>
<p>These are two examples of technology that can be reinvented using or replaced using chatbots. With a responsive chatbot that understands customer context, your customers will never have to wait through another IVR menu. Surveys can also be assessed through an engaging bot, rendering forms irrelevant in the data collection process.</p>
<h3>Better Digital Customer Service: Key to UX</h3>
<p>UX and customer service go together like, well, peanut butter and jelly, or bacon and eggs, or milk and cookies. (Is it lunchtime yet?) Anyway, you get the point&#8230;they go well together.</p>
<p>Focusing on UX means thinking about what ways you can better serve customers through your website and technology infrastructure&#8217;s design. Using chatbots <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/12/23/why-chatbots-could-be-the-secret-weapon-to-elevate-your-customer-experience/#70c1395d4645">positively changes your digital architecture</a> in a number of ways, including by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a platform for 24/7 support and intake</li>
<li>Infusing your brand and customer service values into your business technology infrastructure</li>
<li>Replacing technology that is no longer relevant or needed</li>
<li>Increasing productivity and encouraging efforts toward social listening</li>
<li>Automating otherwise manual processes like lead generation</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above actions help create a more focused customer service experience as well as a better user experience when customers interact with your brand online. There are some chatbot traits that can be optimized to make them even more useful (and fun!) tools for your company.</p>
<h3>Traits of Chatbots Optimized for UX</h3>
<p>A world leader in research-based user experience, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chatbots/">Neilsen Norman group recently explored</a> chatbot optimization for UX and noted the following key concepts:</p>
<p><strong>Interaction style:</strong> Businesses should include both a multiple-choice carousel of pre-decided links and buttons AND opportunities for customers to input sentences to tell their AI bot explicitly what they need. Links and buttons need to be clearly defined so users easily know to click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Menus and resource links:</strong> Uniquely, chatbots have the ability to offer up a number of choices to consumers, and that includes links to other resources. According to Nielsen Norman, this is best handled with menus and links included in the chat window when the context requires it.</p>
<p><strong>Conversations that guide:</strong> When it comes to chatbots, an unexpected query could throw a wrench in the whole thing, sometimes causing users to have to start back at the beginning of the conversation. This could negatively impact user experience, so bots must be optimized for more complex answer chains.</p>
<p><strong>Carousels:</strong> <a href="https://www.realnet.co.uk/news/carousel-sliders-good-practice-or-bad-for-seo">Carousels are contentious</a> in the world of digital products and SEO, but when it comes to chatbots they may be just what you need to offer comprehensive support. Using a slider underneath the chat window allows chat users to scroll through potential options, choosing what works best for them.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong> This last one is actually <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/chatbots-and-their-benefits-for-user-experience-5660259274e7">not from Nielsen Norman research</a>, but we felt it was worth a mention. In a digital climate where big-box retailers are increasing in online revenue and decreasing in foot traffic, there’s little more important than offering personalization to customers. Chatbots support the vision of greater personalization by listening to customer’s specific needs and providing relevant solutions.</p>
<h3>Sharpspring: Experts on User Experience</h3>
<p>In combination with consistently strong human customer service efforts, chatbots offer an amazing opportunity for businesses. Not only do they save time, money and other resources when properly implemented, but they also create a unique customer journey. They can remove several frustration points in your process replacing them with something more natural and intuitive.</p>
