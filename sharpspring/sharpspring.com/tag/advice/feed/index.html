										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the popularity of our Agency Growth Series, we launched Revenue Rockstars — our newest webinar series for agencies and digital marketing leaders. We’re showcasing businesses growing revenue using the SharpSpring Revenue Growth Platform and featuring top marketing talents including Jay Baer, Shama Hyder, Seth Godin, Karl Sakas, and more.</p>
<p>Jay Baer kicked off the series with a live-streamed session on August 5. Jay and Chip House, CMO at SharpSpring, announced our series headliners.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to learn how revenue rockstars grow revenue throughout the entire marketing funnel. You’ll have the opportunity to attend each session live and participate in the Q&amp;As. We’ll also share key takeaways on our blog. Our series will continue through early January 2022.</p>
<p>Our 11 revenue rockstars will solve 11 questions on problems future revenue rockstars encounter. On August 18, Mickey Locey, president and co-founder of mXtr Automation, hosted  “Beyond the Pitch: Rock Star Moves to Not Only Win Business But Deliver on Your Promise.”</p>
<p>Here are some of our favorite <a href="/resources/revenue-rockstars-mickey-locey/">highlights from Mickey’s session</a>. Enjoy and let us know your favorite moments of the series!</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on breaking through the noise to drive real impact</h2>
<p>Yeah, look, I mean, I think when you&#8217;re focusing when you&#8217;re able to identify that one thing which isn&#8217;t always easy to do, right. Again, because there is so much, so many things going on there. What we find is when you have identified it, this really acts as the most common conversation, the center point of your entire strategy as you move forward. Because it allows you to build off that and allows you to then differentiate yourself based on what you&#8217;re going through, because you have this the center track this baseline, if you will, to really focus on.</p>
<p>When we start with a client, when we onboard a client, one of the first things we always do with that client is ask them what success looks like to them. And that helps us get to the root of this one thing. So we ask them, what does success look like at 90 days? What does it look like in six months? What does it look like at one year? As you can imagine the answers for the clients, they differ, right? They&#8217;re different. Certainly, if there&#8217;s one commonality with almost every client, they say I want to sell more widgets, without a doubt. But there&#8217;s other things that come out of that conversation and we&#8217;ll get back to the selling more widgets because that&#8217;s another thing we want to talk about here. There&#8217;s other things that come out of that, other KPIs, other measurable success benchmarks, if you will, that come out of that question that allows us to really focus in on that key factor that we want to make the center point as we move forward. Could be could be something as easy as and as simple as they want to have better connections with their customer base. Could be they&#8217;ve got a small database of customers right now and they&#8217;re looking for ways to grow that database so that they can start to make those connections.</p>
<p>We had one client that told us, look, we&#8217;re struggling to understand our true sales cycle. We don&#8217;t know exactly what it is. We think it&#8217;s X, but it might be Y. So that becomes a focus for them. One of the common ones that we hear a lot is, you know, the last relationship we&#8217;re in the last agency we were working with, our internal marketing team (whatever it might be) we&#8217;re generating leads, but they&#8217;re just not good quality leads. We got to find a way to get better quality leads.</p>
<p>And I think the last one I want to bring up that&#8217;s becoming more and more common with our clients is the data side of things. They want to gain control over their data. Right. And so the list could go on and on and on in terms of other things that they define success as. But when you combine those with all that noise that we talked about at the beginning in terms of the opportunities and you kind of put those together in one thing. It really allows that area of focus to jump out at you, it quickly allows you to understand what that differentiation is and what our opportunity is to drive that biggest impact.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on the secret sauce to sustainable growth</h2>
<p>So you asked me that question when we spoke last time and I’ve been thinking a lot about it. And the reality is that&#8217;s really kind of the secret sauce behind what we do. But the reality is, it&#8217;s not a secret. It&#8217;s not something unique to us or anybody else. It&#8217;s just a philosophy, I think, that you need to make need to buy into. And it&#8217;s kind of an understanding that all things in all aspects of what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish, and what the client is trying to accomplish for their business should focus on one thing, and that&#8217;s the consumer. And this is different than the old “customer is always right”. This is focusing on the consumer. A consumer-centric approach to marketing and specifically with marketing automation.</p>
<p>Our belief, and I say this to every client that we talk to and onboard, and I think it’s hard to argue this point, that there was a day when the idea of marketing was you took your soapbox to town, you get on top of that soapbox and you scream at the top of your lungs all the great things that you do. And people would flock to you to do one of the 10 things that you just listed off. And we kind of carried that through in marketing. And, you know, when you think about the days of email newsletters and sending an email newsletter out with 20 things in it and expect the customer to open that newsletter and figure out of 20 things, what&#8217;s most important to them? That&#8217;s not the way it works anymore.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on creating moments and connecting with your audience</h2>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s right. And so if you&#8217;re doing that right, if you&#8217;re taking that that consumer-centric approach, as we like to call it, what starts to happen as you start to have these really powerful connections? And we always talk about creating moments with your audience. And I think the best part about this is, is that as marketers, I&#8217;m not the smartest guy in the room. I don&#8217;t have to have all the answers anymore. I can start with this one conversation that we talked about moments ago. I can get it in play and guess how I win as a marketer. I&#8217;ve got this great technology I&#8217;m driving all of this data back to. And so now I can listen. I can watch. I can see how that conversation is performing. And the consumer who I&#8217;ve put at the center of my communication is going to tell me what I should do next.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on rockstar agency moves to grow revenue</h2>
<p>We work with a lot of agency partners, as I mentioned. And I and I have this conversation with them all the time. I mean, there is no doubt that if you&#8217;re an agency, if you&#8217;re a marketer at an organization, you have already done the hardest part of what we&#8217;re talking about here today. You have built a website. You have put strategies in place to drive traffic to that website. You&#8217;ve optimized that site to make sure that you&#8217;re getting the most traffic that you can to that site. You&#8217;ve put conversion optimization strategies in place to make sure you&#8217;re putting the leads in the funnel and that you&#8217;re getting as many of them ready for your sales team as you can. So now you convert and a lead enters the funnel. Why would you stop there? Why wouldn&#8217;t you bring that in and then try to continue that conversation and continue having an impact with that consumer all the way through to the sale? We can do that and we should be doing that.</p>
<p>​​That&#8217;s the key to it. Technology puts us in that position now, look, as marketers, we have to make the technology sing, if you will. It&#8217;s the optimization. It&#8217;s the approach that we&#8217;re taking. That&#8217;s the key, the key aspect of all of this. The technology gives us the data, to be able to have those intelligent conversations and ultimately put us in that position to improve with each interaction with our customers.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on becoming an iconic revenue rockstar</h2>
<p>Well and I think talk about that short relationship. I mean, again, we talked a little bit about potentially stopping short with putting leads in the funnel and not doing as well. We shouldn&#8217;t also be focused on the fact that we&#8217;re just trying to get these folks to buy from us. Again, we can&#8217;t stop short here. We have to be consistent. We have to be continuing to develop this relationship. I mean, they come in and they buy once super, we win, okay? We can tell the client that we&#8217;ve got some revenue for them this month. But the fact is that relationship is now stronger than it&#8217;s ever been. And the opportunity now for referrals, you know reviews, up sales, cross-sales, I mean, you name it, whatever the next path is for that particular consumer, you&#8217;re in the driver&#8217;s seat now to have that relationship. You&#8217;re in the driver&#8217;s seat to communicate with that.</p>
<p>There is a reason that our communication out of your platform for clients that we manage for any period of time our open rates in our emails are consistently forty-five percent and plus. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve made a connection with the consumer. They care about what we&#8217;re talking to them about. I mean, you compare that to a typical e-mail newsletter open rate. It&#8217;s significantly different. And when you have that level of interaction with a customer, you&#8217;ve got them to this point. Just be consistent with it. Don&#8217;t give it up. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. Keep providing value to that consumer. And you&#8217;ll have a customer for life as they say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re looking for increased digital marketing success this year, <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/">Google Ads</a> (formerly called AdWords) can help. Google has continued to tweak it’s advertising platform and some of these changes allow for extra targeting, meaning that you are able to reach a very qualified audience.</p>
<p>Since Google has added more ad slots in recent years, the increase in digital content makes it increasingly difficult to rank organically. These factors make Google Ads a platform worthy of adding to your digital marketing efforts.</p>
<p>The following five hacks will help you reach <a href="/blog/9-easy-tips-for-building-out-your-buyer-personas/">your specific audiences</a> and improve your click-through rates. Try using each of these tips together and you will surely be off to a great start with Google Ads.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Add As Many Extensions As Possible</strong></h3>
<p>Extensions can completely transform your ads’ appearance. They allow you to add additional information to your advertisements. And by adding extensions, you&#8217;re lengthening your ad to take up more real estate on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). All of these factors combined make your ad more valuable to searchers, meaning that your ad is more likely to get clicks.</p>
<p>Google allows you to add the following extensions to your ads:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sitelink Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Shows links to specific pages of your website.</em> This means that you are able to highlight additional pages on your website beyond the link on your ad.</li>
<li><strong>Callout Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Shows descriptive text.</em> This allows you to highlight additional features you may not have been able to fit into the text of your ad. Each callout extension can be 25 characters in length.</li>
<li><strong>Structured Snippet Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Highlights specific aspects of your product or service.</em> Structured snippets are only available for pre-defined categories that Google offers, such as Amenities, Destinations, Shows, Styles, Courses, etc. While the list keeps expanding, there may not be a category that applies to your specific business.</li>
<li><strong>Call Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Highlights your phone number.</em> You can add a number for potential customers to call. This is especially helpful if your ads are primarily viewed on mobile and you handle most of your business over the phone. Google does allow you to track calls that come from your ads.</li>
<li><strong>Message Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Encourages people to send your business text messages from your ad.</em> You can receive typed messages either directly to your phone, or Google will forward the message to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>Location Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Shows business information like your location and business hours.</em> Google will add business information it has through your Google My Business profile. Pair those two platforms to enable this feature.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate Location Extensio</strong>n &#8211; <em>Shows all your businesses affiliate locations.</em> If you utilize a retail chain, you can add these locations so that people know that the product or service they are looking for is available at a location near them.</li>
<li><strong>Price Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Allows you to highlight specific prices of your product or services.</em> You can add up to five products or services in one extension. Google allows for the price, a short description, and a link to the product page. That way, when people click on a specific product, they will be taken directly to the right page on your website.</li>
<li><strong>App Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Encourages downloads of your app.</em> If you have an app and want your potential customers to download it directly from your ad, you can feature it as an extension.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion Extension</strong> &#8211; <em>Shows specific sales and offers.</em> If you are trying to highlight a specific deal or offer, promotion extensions will allow you to add that information to your ads. You can also set time limits so the extension will stop running when the promotion ends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add as many of the above extensions as you can to make your ad helpful to searchers and improve your CTR.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Make Sure You’re Using Google Audiences</strong></h3>
<p>Google Audiences allows you to target searchers with specific interests. If you have specific <a href="/blog/2020-tips-developing-buyer-personas/">demographics</a> that you are trying to target, Google will now allow you to set a preference based on who the searcher is (parental status, marital status, education, or homeownership status) and what they are searching for.</p>
<p>Google also allows you to re-market to people who have visited your website in the past. Upload a list of visitors and Google will show your ads to that specific audience when they search for terms that you are targeting through your keywords. This is especially important if you have a longer sales cycle and it takes more interaction points before a lead becomes a customer.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Get Very Specific With Your Locations</strong></h3>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-183580 aligncenter" style="font-size: 16px;" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/locations-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="496" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/locations-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/locations-768x513.jpg 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/locations-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></h3>
<p>Do you have specific areas that you want to target? Do <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/mobile-geo-targeting-trade-show/">certain locations bring in better leads</a> and more customers? Make sure that you are targeting those locations as closely as possible.</p>
<p>If you really only care about specific neighborhoods, look up that area’s zip code and make sure that your ads are being shown to that zip code specifically. The broader your targeting, the less qualified leads you’ll bring in through Google Ads.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you absolutely don’t want your ads being shown to specific areas, be sure to exclude those locations in your targeting. Maybe you only sell a product to the continental United States. If that’s the case, be sure to exclude both Alaska and Hawaii as locations so that you aren’t spending money on clicks from areas where people can’t buy your product.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Adjust Your Bidding Based on Your Goals</strong></h3>
<p>Google allows you to adjust your bid based on a variety of factors (including both location and audiences). By adjusting your bidding, you ensure that you&#8217;re using your ad spend in ways that make sense for your business.</p>
<p>If certain cities represent better leads for your business, make sure to adjust your bid up so that your ads receive a higher position and are shown more often when someone searches from that location.</p>
<p>If you start to notice a pattern where people are clicking on your ads more often when they search for a specific keyword and are converting at a higher rate, adjust your bidding up so that you win a higher share of impressions for that specific keyword.</p>
<p>Conversely, you may not want to compete as heavily in certain areas or for certain keywords. You can also adjust your bidding down so that Google doesn’t show your ads as often for terms that don’t convert at a high rate.</p>
<p>Adjust your bidding to maximize your return on ad spend (ROAS) for Google Ads. You’ll see higher returns when you spend money in the right places for the right searches.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Watch Search Terms Carefully</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-183581" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/search-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="459" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/search-300x191.jpg 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/search-768x488.jpg 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/search-1024x651.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></p>
<p>The Search Terms tab on Google Ads allows you to see what search terms your ads are showing for. Using this section is a great way to identify negative keywords and to find additional keywords to add to your campaigns and ad groups. You can also begin to identify keywords that may need to be an exact match vs. phrase match vs. broad match. If you are only using broad match keywords, chances are that your ads are ending up in a lot of searches that may have nothing to do with your business.</p>
<p>Check search terms to see what terms your ads are showing for on a monthly basis. Are you getting a lot of impressions for a search term, but not a lot of clicks? It might be time to optimize that ad and try to improve your CTR. Are your ads showing for a term that has nothing to do with what you offer? Be sure to add that term as a negative keyword.</p>
<p>By understanding where and how your ads are being shown, you can optimize your keywords and ensure that your ads are only being shown on searches that represent opportunities for your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Google Ads Success Is Incremental</strong></h3>
<p>These hacks for Google Ads represent a well-rounded approach that can be used to optimize your ads. Be sure to re-explore your changes every quarter and <a href="https://phoscreative.com/adwords-lessons/">document the effect</a> it’s having on your overall account. You may find that you are initially too conservative in your bid adjustments or that you missed out on potentially really positive extensions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Google Ads is only one tool in the digital marketing toolbelt. When it is used in conjunction with SEO, social media, email marketing, and <a href="https://sharpspring.com/features/automation/">automation</a>, it is the most powerful. Bring what you’ve learned about your company on other platforms to your Google Ads and you’ll find success this year and for many years to come!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a scary feeling. You’ve got sales breathing down your neck for new leads and management asking for the latest MQL figures. It can be very tempting to make an easy move that could turn out to have terrible consequences.</p>
<p>If you’ve been in marketing for very long at all you probably know where I’m going with this. The purchased list. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>As professional marketers, we all have access to the option of obtaining as many email contacts as we’re willing to purchase. But if you’ve ever watched a scary movie you know how the easy option usually turns out to have serious consequences.</p>
<p>It’s never a good idea for a legitimate marketer to purchase lists. It will almost certainly cause harm to your long-term <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/beginners-guide-email-marketing/">email marketing strategy</a>. Not convinced? Keep reading as I outline the very real dangers of purchased lists.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/aTf4PONtSYB1e/giphy.gif" width="289" height="217" /></p>
<h3>An Uninvited Guest</h3>
<p>I have read many forum discussions, participated in many email list threads, and been part of many face-to-face conversations where a person responsible for sending email for a company asks another person who works for a large mailbox provider the following question: <strong>“Why do my emails go to the spam folder?”</strong></p>
<p>The immediate reply, without fail, is always: “Are you sending to recipients that have requested your email?” Now, this may seem like a silly question, but as far as most mailbox providers are concerned, it is the <strong>most important factor</strong> in determining whether or not your messages get anywhere near the inbox.</p>
<p>Another question that is constantly being asked is: <strong>“Why is my domain on a blocklist?”</strong> Again, the response is almost always: “Are you sending to recipients that have asked for your email?”</p>
<p>There’s a very good reason why the question “Are you sending to recipients that have asked for your email?” is such an appropriate response when dealing with questions related to deliverability. This is because it is the exact same question the systems built by mailbox providers – like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft – are asking when deciding what to do with your email. It is also the foundation upon which many blocklists build their tools.</p>
<p>Are you sending email to recipients that have indicated they want to receive email from you? If you are sending to purchased, rented, or scraped lists, the answer to this question is always going to be “no.” And this can cause major problems for your <a href="/blog/sharpspring-guide-to-understanding-email-metrics/">email campaigns</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/10jUUJz0evYg8/giphy.gif" width="280" height="210" /></p>
<h3>&#8220;Based On Actual Events&#8221;</h3>
<p>Let’s begin by looking at things from the perspective of a mailbox provider. Their job is to ensure that their customer’s inboxes are filled with relevant email. If something gets to the inbox that a customer doesn’t want, it diminishes the customer’s faith in the mailbox provider’s ability to protect them from unwanted email.</p>
<p>As a result, mailbox providers build complex learning systems to keep out unwanted mail. Regardless of whether the lists are described as “clean, targeted, warm” or other misleading buzzwords data providers often use to try to convince you there is some value in their lists, they are still lists full of addresses that <strong>never asked to receive email from you</strong>.  And mailbox providers absolutely know when you are sending to these lists.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if you are sending to <a href="https://worldbestnews.info/the-truth-about-buying-email-lists/">purchased lists</a>, it is almost guaranteed you will have a lower open rate and higher spam complaint rate. And this not only affects the recipients on the purchased lists, it also decreases the chance that any other email you send will get in the inbox. Sending to purchased lists will lower your reputation at mailbox providers, meaning it lowers the level of trust they have that you are sending emails that are wanted by their customers. If you keep sending to purchased lists, some mailbox providers will go so far as to start bouncing back all of your emails.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs7U04OERhUtefja/giphy.gif" width="241" height="241" /></p>
<h3>Don’t Fall (into a Spam Trap)</h3>
<p>By now you’re probably sold on the fact that the negative impact of sending to purchased lists far outweighs any perceived value they may have. Still not convinced? Don’t worry, it gets worse!</p>
<p>As noted earlier, many data providers like to entice unsuspecting marketers with guarantees that their emails are “99% valid” or “high-quality” and “highly deliverable.” What this really means is that there is a server that is willing to accept mail sent to these addresses. It does <em>not</em> mean these addresses are owned and operated by individual potential consumers. When sending to a purchased list, there’s a good chance you’re hitting at least one of many spam trap networks.</p>
<p>Now you may be asking, “what are spam trap networks?” I’m so glad you asked! These are groups of addresses that are deliverable but were established with the intent of detecting companies that are sending unsolicited email.</p>
<p>To be clear, the email addresses that are part of these networks have never been used to sign up for anything. There is absolutely no reason they should ever be on a list of recipients that have asked to receive email. So, if an email is sent to one of these addresses it is a clear indication that the sender has obtained the list by a method that did not include consent by the recipient. And these spam trap networks are usually accompanied by a domain blocklist that lists senders who have sent to their trap network.</p>
<p>These domain blocklists are used by mailbox providers to bolster their own protective measures and ensure that only mail that is wanted by their recipients reaches their inbox. If you are on a domain blocklist, any mail you send to a mailbox provider that subscribes to that blocklist will be rejected.</p>
<p>None of your email will even reach the spam folder until you have been removed from the blocklist which can last days or in some cases months, or even years. And even after you have gotten off of the blocklist, you’ll still have to repair your reputation for each mailbox provider, which can take even longer. Clearly, this can have lasting impact on your ability to reach the inbox. In other words, it’s bad news.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpOjkiEjzJ1ZaJG/giphy.gif" width="293" height="169" /></p>
<h3>Turn Back Before It’s Too Late</h3>
<p>SharpSpring, like all other major marketing automation and email sending platforms, prohibits the use of purchased lists. At the end of the day, as marketers we all want to promote our products and services to a receptive audience. The best and easiest way to ensure the quality of this audience is by using inbound lead generation methods such as <a href="/features/landingpagebuilder/">landing pages</a>, SEO, social media ads, chatbots, and <a href="/features/sharpspring-social/">social outreach</a> – all of which are available within the <a href="/features/">SharpSpring platform</a>.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, buyer beware! Purchased lists may seem like an easy way to kickstart interest in your product or increase your visibility, but they actually end up reducing your audience and could cause massive harm to your ability to reach the inbox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new SharpSpring Agency Growth Series features an awesome curated lineup of the top influencers in digital marketing. We could not be more excited about the <a href="https://sharpspring.com/agency-acceleration-series-partners/">group of great minds</a> we were lucky enough to pull together to make this agency-focused series happen.</p>
<p>The free series is made up of 14 unique web sessions, all with a livestream Q&amp;A segment, and all focused on helping agencies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Sessions feature digital marketing superstars speaking candidly about the industry topics they know best and are most passionate about. And we want to make sure to share the love – so, in addition to providing recordings of the sessions and live Q&amp;As, we’ll also be posting key takeaways here following each session.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at a few key highlights we pulled from our recent Agency Growth Series session “Influencer Marketing &amp; SEO” with author, speaker and tech company founder, Rand Fishkin.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on challenges for agencies</h3>
<p>I think that a lot of agencies sell themselves short by not having conversations around strategy and how it connects to tactics. And so, you know, the challenge becomes building a practice where you can have that higher level executive conversation about why are you trying to achieve these things, and what are the goals for what you&#8217;re achieving. And then how do we know how to do the tactics that we&#8217;re engaging in, plug into that?</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on influencer marketing</h3>
<p>I think that six, seven years ago, influencer marketing, you know, the definition, if you&#8217;d asked marketers, ‘Hey, what is influencer marketing?’, they would&#8217;ve said, &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s the process whereby you go and find all of the sources of influence, the blogs and Web sites and mainstream media and podcasts and YouTube channels and social accounts that your audience follows, listens to, pays attention to and you go do marketing in all of those places directly,&#8217; which, which I think is brilliant. What a great way to do marketing.</p>
<p>Today, unfortunately, influencer marketing has come to mean pay half naked people on Instagram $500 to pose with your product, which is a very niche tactic that&#8217;s probably dumb for most people, but works for a few B2C brands in some very particular industries. And it&#8217;s extremely frustrating to me that the definition of that phrase has changed.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on hiring agencies vs. employees</h3>
<p>I love using agencies. It helps my cost structure. I get way more value from working with savvy agencies and consultants because they see my problem, you know, 100 times in a year from 100 different companies instead of just once from us, right? And so the perspective that they bring, the ability to make smart, quick decisions is is just terrific, right? Having seen that problem before and seen how people solved it or didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s huge. I, I love that.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on demand for SEO</h3>
<p>My perception is that there is more opportunity now in SEO than there ever has been. Meaning there&#8217;s there&#8217;s more interest, there are more companies that are investing in it, that want to invest in it. I get emails almost every day asking me, &#8216;Hey, do you provide SEO services?&#8217; To which of course, my answer is &#8216;no, but I can probably refer you to somebody good who does.&#8217;</p>
<p>And my sense on the on the other side of that, on the on the negative side of that equation, is that I have been monitoring for several years and reporting on it via the <a href="https://sparktoro.com/">SparkToro</a>, our blog, Clickstream data, about what&#8217;s happening with Google&#8217;s search volume and what&#8217;s happening with their search referrals. And you can see a pretty clear pattern in the last five or six years where Google is essentially doing two, three things.</p>
<p>Number one, the percent of searches that result in a paid click–click on one of Google&#8217;s ads–that has gone up pretty dramatically, I think, 30, 35 percent over the last five, six years, maybe even more than that. Simultaneously, the percent of clicks that Google is sending back to their own properties. So you search Google, you get to Google Maps, Google Flights, Google Hotels, Google Jobs, YouTube. You know, one of Google&#8217;s entertainment sort of one boxes, right? That gives you all the details about that stuff. Or go back to enhanced results inside Google search itself. That number has been climbing pretty dramatically. I believe the last time I got data was January, and it was around 6 percent of all searches, 12 percent of all clicks, going back to an Alphabet property, which is obviously Google&#8217;s parent company.</p>
<p>And then the third one is the worst news of all, which is that the percentage, of course, the percentage of searches that result in an organic non paid click, which is where SEO gets all of its value, that&#8217;s gone down, right? And that&#8217;s dropped fairly precipitously. It&#8217;s more on mobile than on desktop. And so, interestingly enough, in the pandemic, when we&#8217;re all at home and we&#8217;re on our desktops and laptops, that number hasn&#8217;t been shrinking as fast this year. It&#8217;s been sort of plateauing as a result of everybody using their desktops more and their mobiles a little less.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on SparkToro&#8217;s most successful acquisition channel</h3>
<p>Our most successful acquisition channel by far, and very obviously, is other people&#8217;s platforms. So essentially every week I am doing a few things, just like what I&#8217;m doing with you today Chip, and essentially being on other people&#8217;s podcasts, doing webinars, doing events and conferences. I&#8217;ve done a number of like AMAs on different Web sites and in different communities and been published on other people&#8217;s blogs and written about and a lot of that comes through essentially my own activity, like going to social networks, you know, posting some things, engaging, building relationships. We&#8217;ve done a lot of email marketing, all that kind of stuff.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on email versus social media</h3>
<p>So you can see that–you know, whatever it was six years ago, seven years ago–the average engagement rate on a Facebook page post was in 7-8% range. Today, the average engagement rate with a page with a post from the percent of people who liked a page is 0.09%. That&#8217;s according to <a href="https://www.rivaliq.com/">Rival IQ</a>, who puts out a very good report every year. But 0.09% is&#8230; Why would you ever try and get Facebook likes? What&#8217;s the point? Right? Just get an email address. My God. Email addresses, they&#8217;ll have a 25% open rate.</p>
<h3>Rand Fishkin on the power of sleep</h3>
<p>To be honest, the best advice I can give you is it&#8217;s very challenging but sleep, getting lots of sleep, not just <em>enough</em> sleep, but a lot of sleep is really good for your mental health and psychology.</p>
<p>And, you know, when I think about what an agency owner, what a manager, what a CEO has to do, well, it is to make great decisions. And all the scientific research in the world says that your decision-making skills will be best when you are well-fed and well-rested and in reasonably good shape.</p>
<p>Your physical body is what is providing a ton of the quality around your decision making. So if you can find ways, whatever they are, to get, you know, nine hours in bed and eight hours of sleep or however much, you know, your body needs, that will be that will be huge. It&#8217;s way more important for you to do that than get that extra hour of work in. Those extra two hours of work in.</p>
<p>I think that we have this weird culture in American entrepreneurship that prioritizes and glorifies the sacrifice of your body and yourself and your health in exchange for your business and that is not how it works at all. That is, in fact, the opposite of how, how you do well in your working life. You, you sleep well, you eat well, you get your 45 minutes of exercise a day. You know, you go on your walk, you ignore your e-mail for a little bit and your decision-making skills, your ability to choose what you invest in and how and why, will be massively upgraded. That&#8217;s, I think, how you keep your sanity and momentum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Start-ups are often pressed for both money and time. As they strive to make their presence felt, start-ups must cope with various business challenges and numerous operational tasks all at once. Marketing is one of the most critical concerns that many start-ups struggle to optimize. Practical marketing, or lack thereof, can make or break your business. As you strive to amplify your marketing efforts, <a href="/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> can deliver significant benefits at affordable costs.</p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving market, before you go all out on your marketing automation quest, you should take a step back and consider various factors. For instance, without proper considerations, you might rush and overbuy on a marketing automation solution only to spend more while realizing little to no desirable ROI. If you are considering it, here are a few marketing automation tips to help you make the right decisions for your business.</p>
<h2>Top Marketing Automation Tips for Start-ups</h2>
<h3>1. Understand your target</h3>
<p>Before you can implement effective marketing strategies, understanding your target and <a href="/persona-development/">creating effective personas</a> is crucial. Your marketing personas address the target audience with a voice that represents varying user demographics. As such, while working towards an efficient strategy, understanding your target is vital. It allows you to tailor the message in a relatable way, allowing you to capture not only your visitors’ attention but also offer valuable information to ease their decision making while tipping them in your business’ favor. In other words, you can <em>send the right message to the right person at the right time</em>, based on personas.</p>
<p>While automating your marketing efforts, understanding your target means that you are not just spamming their mailboxes with irrelevant content, but instead, you are offering value. From your landing pages, blog posts, whitepapers, and surveys, to podcasts or videos, understanding your audience allows you to deliver <a href="/blog/how-to-take-marketing-personalization-to-the-next-level/">personalized content</a> that generates and nurtures quality leads.<br />
With this strategic approach, marketing automation boosts your campaigns by streamlining operations and saving time and money while increasing sales revenue, which translates to improved profitability.</p>
<h3>2. Set your goals</h3>
<p>Why does your start-up need marketing automation? What do you want to achieve? These questions need to be addressed before you start your search for an ideal marketing automation solution.</p>
<p>Whether creating <a href="/blog/understanding-brand-voice-how-to-differentiate-and-amplify-your-messaging/">brand awareness</a>, <a href="/blog/accelerate-lead-generation-content/">generating leads</a>, and/or <a href="/marketing/how-to-measure-marketing-automation-success/">enhancing conversion rates</a>, marketing automation can only be useful if you set the right goals. With effective goals in place, you can employ an efficient marketing strategy and supercharge it with the right marketing automation solution.</p>
<h3>3. Choose the right tool</h3>
<p>Here is where it can get tricky! With the many available solutions on the market, you can easily be swayed by platforms that promise the world to your start-up but <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/marketing-automation">fail to deliver</a>.</p>
<p>While including marketing automation in your campaigns can help you fast-track your business success, choosing the wrong tools can cost you not only in wasted money but in lost time, as well. While it doesn’t require a tech-savvy user to identify the right automation tools, you can easily be blinded by flashy offers leading to the purchase of unnecessary functionalities that your business simply doesn’t need.</p>
<p>By following your set goals, however, you can identify <a href="/features/automation/">marketing automation software</a> that falls not only within your budget but that meets your specific business needs, too. By reviewing the different available software’s functions, you can comfortably narrow your search to a choice that matches your needs, allowing you to accomplish the set goals without unnecessary functionalities that will add zero value for your company or clients.</p>
<h2>The takeaway</h2>
<p>As you strive to optimize your campaigns using these marketing automation tips, seeking professional services could be all you need to ensure that your business implements laser-focused strategies and automation tools that truly match your needs.</p>
<p>With data such as anonymous visitor identification and other campaign tracking measures, reliable services allow your business to choose and use marketing automation tools that attract quality leads, nurture them, and enhance your conversion rates.</p>
<p>Enjoying a competitive edge requires a rigorous and effective marketing strategy, and marketing automation has a lot to offer on this front. From simplifying and streamlining operations, saving time and money, to the reduction of human error and enhanced marketing efficiency, with the right automation tools, start-ups can find themselves on the fast-track towards success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new SharpSpring Agency Growth Series features an awesome curated lineup of the top influencers in digital marketing. We could not be more excited about the <a href="https://sharpspring.com/agency-acceleration-series/">group of great minds</a> we were lucky enough to pull together to make this agency-focused series happen.</p>
<p>The free series is made up of 14 unique web sessions, all with a livestream Q&amp;A segment, and all focused on helping agencies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Sessions feature digital marketing superstars speaking candidly about the industry topics they know best and are most passionate about. And we want to make sure to share the love – so, in addition to providing recordings of the sessions and live Q&amp;As, we’ll also be posting key takeaways here following each session.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at a few key highlights we pulled from our recent Agency Growth Series session “What SMBs Want From Agencies” with NYT best-selling author and marketing industry giant, Chris Brogan.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on the Importance of Contrast</h3>
<p>So the moment we start copying somebody else&#8217;s agency, the moment we start copying somebody else, people tune out magically, it&#8217;s just a power. They knock it right out because they decide, I don&#8217;t have to pay attention anymore because you&#8217;ve just indicated to me that you&#8217;re going to say things that I&#8217;ve already heard before. So, the first thing you need to really do is have some sense of contrast.</p>
<p>You have to have some sense that in your message, in how you&#8217;re communicating on behalf of small and medium businesses, that you&#8217;re not saying the same thing you would say for other businesses and you&#8217;re not saying the same thing similar industry businesses would be saying. That you&#8217;re saying things in a way that really connects with the people that you&#8217;re hoping to reach on behalf of the client. So, let’s start there. So contrast is important.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on Reach and Exposure</h3>
<p>What any business wants with regards to marketing, is also a combination of reach and exposure. So reach and exposure are kind of what we think of as primary marketing and advertising tools, right? So if you see the same ad a bunch of times in retargeting, then that&#8217;s a lot more exposure to the ad. If you see it on pretty much every site you ever go to, that&#8217;s reach, right, so reach plus exposure are two things that we always want to see in everything we do with the customers and the people we have the opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>And so examples of that are just the mechanics of marketing and advertising, meaning spend on ads. Definitely spend on ads. It&#8217;s interesting. People have me pegged as one kind of a person because I do a lot of content creation and because I say a lot of good things about social platforms and social networks. And I still think there&#8217;s some great value and some great opportunities in doing so. But I also think that if you&#8217;re not looking at the number one and number two search engines in the world, Google and YouTube, then you&#8217;re missing out on an opportunity. Why wouldn&#8217;t you want that kind of ROI?</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on Articulation</h3>
<p>Articulation matters. And articulation is, you know, clarity and brevity. Your message has to be tight. Simple, repeatable. And so when you&#8217;re helping market a small or medium business, your job is to be really clear, be really brief. People can&#8217;t stand all the backstory. You know, there&#8217;s jokes about, if you ever want a recipe off the internet, get ready to hear about that person&#8217;s dog and how they had a really weird front porch growing up. Because you don&#8217;t ever just get the ingredients and how long to cook everything. Every blog post about a recipe is like a 20-minute ordeal now. And that&#8217;s not what people really want. Right? So articulation is clarity and brevity. Can you say it simply and tell it to me like I&#8217;m six years old? Clarity and brevity, they so matter. So that&#8217;s what articulation is all about.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on Trust and “Echo”</h3>
<p>The last two thoughts of what small businesses need and medium businesses need are trust and what I call &#8220;echo&#8221;. And those kind of go together, as well. They want to trust and understand who you are. We talk a lot about this concept of authenticity. I&#8217;m doing quotes because, and if you&#8217;re not watching, I&#8217;m making air quotes. I&#8217;m doing quotes around &#8220;trust&#8221;, because a lot of times when we talk about authenticity, we don&#8217;t really mean that. What we mean is we want to appear authentic or we want to appear like we care or we want to appear like we are exactly who we are all the time. But the other part of business, the other way that makes authenticity actually happen is integrity.</p>
<p>Now, the word integrity gets used wrong all the time. But integrity really just basically means the integrated-ness of what you&#8217;re doing, what you say is what you do and you back it up.</p>
<p>And then, echo is the thing that people think they&#8217;re saying when they say authenticity, which is sort of that &#8220;I&#8217;m a lot like you&#8221; kind of a thing. I&#8217;m a person of the people. I&#8217;m in this space. We ran into this at the very beginning of coronavirus, if you noticed a lot of celebrities and a lot of people that we gave our attention to. We suddenly had that feeling of, wow, I&#8217;m home eating kind of the back of the fridge kind of stuff now. And they&#8217;re complaining that they can&#8217;t go out somewhere fancy for their award show. You know, that sense that they&#8217;re not like us. As much as those trashy daytime, you know, news things at the grocery store want to say they&#8217;re just like us. No, they&#8217;re not. Echo is, &#8220;I&#8217;m like you&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on Being Yoda</h3>
<p>I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s sort of a relationship change that we need to talk about. There was a time where a lot of companies looked at their agency as, basically, you do all this work and then hand me the Glengarry leads and let&#8217;s call it good. And that&#8217;s how that worked. And it&#8217;s not that way anymore. Agencies now have to serve as kind of a guide person. So we were talking about our mutual appreciation of the book and the system <em>StoryBrand</em> with Donald Miller. And he says that, you know, you got to remember that your customer is always Luke. They&#8217;re Luke or Leia, and that your job as an agency is to be Yoda. Your job is to equip them with the technology tools and skills to get going.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on Avoiding Attrition When Budgets are Tightening</h3>
<p>In some ways you have to look at how people are going to work with and/or manage their budgets, anyway. So, for instance, some people are, you know, they&#8217;ve got their payment system set up that they&#8217;re gonna pay every six months or pay every year, or whatever. Well, one quick, easy way to keep the same budget going is have them pay quarterly or monthly or whatever you want to do. Now, that can make you freak out as an agency because you&#8217;re kind of counting on certain revenue. And when you break that number down a little, that scares you because you&#8217;re like, well, what if they cancel or something? Or what if they just choose not to pay the next one? Well, if they can&#8217;t pay, they&#8217;re not going to pay. That&#8217;s not a thing to think about. But making it easier to pay is one way, which you never would expect that would be my answer. But it is.</p>
<h3>Chris Brogan on the SMB Advantage</h3>
<p>And so working with some of the biggest guys, the problem that they always have is that everything is so systematized, everything fits a spreadsheet. So everything is absolutely uniform and they just cannot turn so fast. It&#8217;s like having a big fleet ship in the Navy compared to a small gunboat. The gunboat doesn&#8217;t have as many resources, you know, it doesn&#8217;t have any of the stuff that a big giant ship has. But boy, can it move fast. Dodge things, redirect and realign and take on the environment.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s so much more benefit to being small or even medium, but with a small look. Because then you can get that boutique look and feel and, you know, look what everyone&#8217;s trying to copy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new SharpSpring Agency Growth Series features an awesome curated lineup of the top influencers in digital marketing. We could not be more excited about the <a href="https://sharpspring.com/agency-acceleration-series-partners/">group of great minds</a> we were lucky enough to pull together to make this agency-focused series happen.</p>
<p>The free series is made up of 14 unique web sessions, all with a livestream Q&amp;A segment, and all focused on helping agencies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Sessions feature digital marketing superstars speaking candidly about the industry topics they know best and are most passionate about. And we want to make sure to share the love – so, in addition to providing recordings of the sessions and live Q&amp;As, we’ll also be posting key takeaways here following each session.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of our favorite insights from our Agency Growth Series session with agency owner, consultant and author <a href="https://www.drewmclellan.com/">Drew McLellan</a>.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on how agencies can earn their influence as an expert</h3>
<p>Audiences out there are much more cynical about paid endorsements and things like that. And so their sniff test for B.S. is pretty strong. So the way we earn influence is by being helpful – as ridiculously simple as that sounds.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the key. A good teacher does not sell from the pulpit wherever they&#8217;re teaching. So whether it&#8217;s their podcast or they&#8217;ve written a book or they&#8217;ve they&#8217;re sharing some research they share, they teach frequently and generously, but without a sales pitch. And that&#8217;s the hardest thing for agency owners.</p>
<p>We are so wired to sell, but we have to think of the prospects that we are teaching. We have to think of our students as deer that we would like to come into our yard and eat from our hand. And if we rush at the deer prematurely, they run back into the forest. But if we just keep earning their trust over and over and over again by being helpful, they keep coming closer and closer to us. And sooner or later, they will ask us for help.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on how can agency leaders can find their niche</h3>
<p>In terms of determining our niche, honestly, we make it more complicated than it needs to be. If you look at the case studies you always show. If you look at the clients that you really love. If you look at the industries, or again the audience, or the methodology, that you go back to over and over again, odds are, you know, that’s what your niches are.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on why agencies should find a niche</h3>
<p>One of the disadvantages of not niching of being a generalist is you really are bound by geography. No one is going to drive by five primary care physicians to get to the sixth one. But we will drive hundreds of miles to get to Mayo Clinic over our regular doctor. So one of the challenges, if you&#8217;re a generalist, is you are bound by probably a two or three-hour drive.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ve really narrowed the field of who you can serve and it makes it very difficult for you to be not only findable, but sought after because your content has to be broad to cover the butcher and the baker and the candlestick maker.</p>
<p>I think the reasons why agencies don&#8217;t do it are, number one: biz dev. (Although it should be the number one job for every agency owner out there.) You&#8217;re so busy running from fire to fire to fire that it&#8217;s hard for you to stop and think about these big picture things and make the changes and then implement them to your agency. So, number one, it&#8217;s a time issue.</p>
<p>Number two: it&#8217;s a focus issue. Number three, I think is, I think it is mostly fear based. So, for example, I&#8217;ve had a lot of agencies say to me, &#8216;Man, I am glad that I wasn&#8217;t in the travel and tourism industry during COVID.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;You know what? Actually, the AMI agencies that specialize in travel and tourism because they were so specialists as those companies were coming back out of their hibernation and starting to spend again. Guess who they sought after? The specialists.&#8217;</p>
<p>Those agencies are all back in the black. They&#8217;re all doing fine. So there is no, and by the way, they were killing it for the nine years between the recession and COVID. So, yeah, every once in a while you&#8217;re going to have a tough year, but you&#8217;re gonna have that is an agency no matter what.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on the services agencies should be thinking about in 2020 and beyond</h3>
<p>Our research shows that what clients want is – and we talk about it a lot, but I don&#8217;t know that we do it very well yet as a group – they want an agency to be able to help them harvest the data that they have, and use that data to make better and more proactive decisions. And so certainly tools like SharpSpring and other AI tools and things like that give us a wealth of data.</p>
<p>So clients <em>have</em> the data they just have no idea what it means. So they need an interpreter. And that&#8217;s what an agency really can do well, is to look at the data and be able to say, ‘You know what, based on what we&#8217;re seeing, we should be heading in this direction or we should be talking more about this.’</p>
<p>The other thing that is really interesting is clients are asking agencies to help them with brand. They&#8217;re asking them to help them decide how to deal with or if they should deal with social issues. Right now, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure on all companies out there to have to take a stand on some of the social issues that we&#8217;re facing in the world today. And they don&#8217;t know how to do that effectively and well. And so they don&#8217;t have a lot of courage around it. So part of what an agency does for their clients is give them courage to get out there and express their opinion, if that makes sense. But a lot of it is around harnessing the insights that technology gives us that our clients don&#8217;t know how to do.</p>
<h3>Drew McLeallan on retaining customers and customer communication</h3>
<p>What our research shows is that clients, one of the main reasons why a client leaves an agency is because they sort of feel like they are taken advantage of. And what they say to us literally is, &#8216;You know what? The agency used to bring me flowers on a Tuesday because they wanted my business so badly and now I don&#8217;t even get flowers on our anniversary anymore.&#8217; Like, I don&#8217;t feel important to them. And certainly one of the ways you can make them feel important is by being an authority. And again, that reinforces their buying decision.</p>
<p>But some of the other things that you should be doing as agencies are you should have a program –so when we teach biz dev – one of the categories of business development that we make you write a plan around is your existing clients, because remember, a lot of your net new income should come from those existing clients. So that&#8217;s not going to happen if you don&#8217;t nurture those relationships. If you don&#8217;t reinforce their buying decision. And so regular communication.</p>
<p>One of the techniques that we suggest is what I call the, &#8216;Pssst&#8230; Email&#8217;, which is, &#8216;Hey, clients, we&#8217;re watching this thing over here. We&#8217;re not talking about it publicly. It&#8217;s not on our blog or in our podcast. But we want you to know that we&#8217;re talking about it&#8217; and sort of giving them some education, because one of the things that we&#8217;ve seen is as an agency steps into an authority position the clients go, &#8216;Man, you&#8217;re kind of giving away the goods to everybody. So what&#8217;s in it for me as your clients?&#8217;</p>
<p>You want to hold back some of your data, some of your best teaching. And we do that, for example, with our research. We release our research every year, but we hold back some of the data and we only give it to AMI members. So we&#8217;re reinforcing that they have a value in being a part of our tribe. So I think we should all be doing that as agencies.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on selling when clients have decreasing budgets</h3>
<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a couple of things. Number one, yeah, you&#8217;re right. Right now, clients have a smaller budget, but recognize that this is a moment, not a forever. And so what I would be doing is I would be doubling down on anybody who&#8217;s in the pipeline that I already have a conversation going with and I have a relationship with.</p>
<p>And if their budget is smaller in the beginning, I know as we come out of COVID and the recession starts to ease up, those dollars are going to come back. I also would really double down with your current clients. They&#8217;re already giving you money. And so it&#8217;s easier for them to give you more money than it is for someone to give you the first dollar.</p>
<p>And the other thing I want to remind you is when you are perceived as an expert, you will be the first one that gets sought after. So one of the things that I would love for you to be doing during this time is really establishing that position of expertise so that when someone goes looking for an agency with that knowledge, you show up. And so that shortens your sales cycle significantly. And by the way, as I said in the video, you&#8217;re able to charge a premium because you&#8217;re not a generalist.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on prospecting for new business when decision makers don&#8217;t know you</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;ve defined your niche, it&#8217;s pretty easy to put together a target list of people who are going to care about your expertise. So you actually already have the expertise. The world may not know it yet. You may not have written your book yet. You may not have launched your podcast, whatever it is, but you already know your stuff. You&#8217;re good at what you do. And if you&#8217;ve narrowed down to a niche, whatever that is, you picked it because you have experience, you have case studies and you know more than the average bear about that.</p>
<p>So I would start talking to them about that. &#8216;Hey, we use a checklist for our clients that they should use before they appear on a news show. Would you be interested in seeing that? Because I know that you have been on a lot of newscasts lately.&#8217; &#8216;Hey, we have a tool that we share with our clients that helps them write a blog post in half of the time, I would love to send that to you.&#8217; So I&#8217;m being interesting, right? I&#8217;m helping them do their job better.</p>
<p>One of the things that needs to repeat in your brain over and over and over again is, ‘How am I helping this person do their job better today?’ Which has nothing to do with them hiring me. It&#8217;s just I am being helpful. I am being interesting. And of course, they&#8217;re gonna go, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry. And what do you do again and how do you do that?&#8217; And sooner or later, you&#8217;re gonna get into a conversation where you can talk to them about doing work for them.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t rush at them because none of us like that. I mean, think about when you go into a retail store, what is the one thing you don&#8217;t want to have happen? Right? You don&#8217;t want to have four salespeople converging upon you all asking if they can help you. Same thing. They don&#8217;t like it any more than we do.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on making sure your message is heard</h3>
<p>The way you break through the clutter is by being very clear about what you&#8217;re going to teach and how the recipient can use it in their daily life, in their job to make their job better. In our cases, it’s to keep their job by making up for all the lost sales during COVID, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>So the clarity that you are offering, something that they can put into action right now and that it&#8217;s going to have an impact and make a difference. That to me is how you break through the clutter. And if you do that well, brevity doesn&#8217;t matter because they&#8217;re going to be so hungry for something that actually is valuable that they will consume long form content or read your book or listen to your podcast, even though it&#8217;s a whole hour.</p>
<p>They will consume it because it&#8217;s meaningful to them. So that&#8217;s the trick. Before you push out anything, whether you&#8217;re sending an email to a prospect or you&#8217;re pushing out something to your entire mailing list. Ask yourself, ‘Is this helpful? Am I teaching something useful? And is my recipient going to go, &#8216;Wow, I&#8217;m going to put away something else to look at this, because I know there&#8217;s meat on that bone.&#8217;’ If you can do that, you&#8217;re golden.</p>
<h3>Drew McLellan on capabilities meetings</h3>
<p>The biggest mistake I see – and I see it in large agencies, small agencies – is we talk about ourselves through most of the capabilities. Yes, they&#8217;re asking for your capabilities, but they really don&#8217;t care about you. So you need to frame your capabilities in relation to them and how you can help them. And case studies that, again, even in your capabilities presentation, you should be teaching them things that they could employ, whether they hire you or not.</p>
<p>So in a 30 minute capabilities or a 60 minute capabilities, the &#8216;about the agency&#8217; part, where you&#8217;re really talking about yourself, should be about 10 percent. That&#8217;s it. And then the rest of it is in relation to them. How can you be helpful? And that&#8217;s the biggest mistake I see in present – in capabilities presentations – that if they&#8217;ve asked you for a capabilities presentation, they&#8217;ve already decided you&#8217;re able to do the job. This is a chemistry check. And they just want to hear how you present. See how they connect with you.</p>
<p>So the more you talk about them, the more interesting they&#8217;re going to think you are. Just like at any cocktail party, the people who ask us the most questions about us are the most fascinating conversationalists we&#8217;ve ever met. We have to employ that in our capabilities presentation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new SharpSpring Agency Growth Series features an awesome curated lineup of the top influencers in digital marketing. We could not be more excited about the <a href="https://sharpspring.com/agency-acceleration-series-partners/">group of great minds</a> we were lucky enough to pull together to make this agency-focused series happen.</p>
<p>The free series is made up of 14 unique web sessions, all with a livestream Q&amp;A segment, and all focused on helping agencies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Sessions feature digital marketing superstars speaking candidly about the industry topics they know best and are most passionate about. And we want to make sure to share the love – so, in addition to providing recordings of the sessions and live Q&amp;As, we’ll also be posting key takeaways here following each session.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at a few key insights from our recent Agency Growth Series session with “The Zen Master of Marketing,” agency owner, TV personality and author Shama Hyder.</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on scaling your agency the right way</h3>
<p>I know people get really excited by it. They want this growth. But I realize I don&#8217;t want growth for growth&#8217;s sake. I&#8217;m working with some amazing clients, doing some great work, and then all of a sudden I kind of had this epiphany and was like, you know what? I don&#8217;t want it. This is too much. We&#8217;ve got to scale back. And now, funnily enough, once we scaled back, I was then able to, as I got older, have more skills. Right? To deal with growth and leadership.</p>
<p>So now we&#8217;re again scaling up again, but doing so much more strategically, much more thoughtfully. It&#8217;s not sort of haphazard, like you know, &#8220;the clients need us and we&#8217;re gonna be anything they need us to be,&#8221; but much more, you know, maybe be partner with other agencies, maybe partner with the right platforms.</p>
<p>I wanted to give you an honest answer, because I know people always want to glamorize it, like, oh, &#8220;scaling and getting big,” but you know, it&#8217;s not so sexy. It&#8217;s a lot of hard work and you have to do a lot of soul searching.<em> </em></p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on “engineering virality”</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to hone in on what you&#8217;re the best at, right? So, we don&#8217;t make websites anymore. We have great partners. We work with them for that. We don&#8217;t focus on that anymore. One of the things that we really excel at is helping our clients find these key moments and then building momentum out of that.</p>
<p>Essentially, these moments can look like anything. It might be a launch. It might be an internal leadership change. It might be something that they&#8217;re really excited about. But it&#8217;s kind of using something like that to create almost an inordinate amount of marketing or buzz around it in our work. In a lot of worlds that&#8217;s called &#8220;virality,&#8221; right? How do you engineer virality? So that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re good at.</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on “walking the talk”</h3>
<p>You know, for me, it&#8217;s very important that we <em>always </em>walk our talk. So, that&#8217;s why when you see when you go to our site, you&#8217;ll see the accolades, you&#8217;ll see the case studies, you&#8217;ll see, you know, the awards. And it&#8217;s not just because it&#8217;s this kind of glorification. For me, it&#8217;s much more about&#8230;I always do a lot of self reflection. I feel like I can&#8217;t in good conscience ask our clients to do something that we aren&#8217;t doing.</p>
<p>So, I mean, we&#8217;ve been blogging since &#8217;08, right? And we blog regularly. Produce content, regularly do videos. So that everything that I&#8217;m talking about, then, doesn&#8217;t come from theory. You know, we&#8217;re talking from, like, actual in the trenches for our clients, but also for ourselves.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world the, you know, &#8220;the cobbler&#8217;s children have no shoes”&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t fly. Because, you know, it starts with you, right? It starts with what are you doing for yourself. We&#8217;re so lucky. We have an amazing roster of clients,, Chase Business, the U.S. Navy. Just amazing leadership. Great brands. But to be able to do that, all the stuff that we&#8217;ve attracted and built in the last decade, you know, so many times clients will come say &#8220;do for me what you&#8217;ve done for you guys,” and I love that!</p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s the ultimate compliment because I feel like it starts with, you know, we&#8217;ve got to walk the talk. I can&#8217;t tell clients, hey, you&#8217;ve got to do more video and then I never do video, that doesn&#8217;t work for me.</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on deciding what agency services to offer</h3>
<p>I think you have to find what you&#8217;re good at and where the demand is, right? Because there&#8217;s times where you&#8217;re really good at something, but the demand may not be there. There&#8217;s just too many people offering whatever it is. Well, on the flip side, there might be a lot of demand for something that&#8217;s just not your jam, right? That&#8217;s not where you excel and your team excels. And so there&#8217;s a disconnect.</p>
<p>For us, yeah, it took years. And, you know, it&#8217;s funny because I feel like in the agency world, the more dynamic you can be, the better. So it almost works better to constantly refine what you&#8217;re offering because then you&#8217;re able to keep up, not just with what you&#8217;re good at, but like with what the market needs, right? How are you meeting market demand?</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on the fun of an “agency ecosystem”</h3>
<p>So much of our business now comes with agency partners. Because, again, for example, we don&#8217;t do e-commerce websites, so we partner with a firm and then they, in turn, don&#8217;t do media relations, etc.</p>
<p>And so it&#8217;s kind of fun, too, because when you figure out what you&#8217;re really good at, you then realize that you don&#8217;t see other agencies as competition. You start to see it as part of this ecosystem where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;wow, we all did what we&#8217;re really great at&#8221; and we could serve so many more people, more clients, and serve them at a higher level.</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on self-honesty</h3>
<p>You know, I think at some point, every agency owner stops and goes, &#8220;should I be doing this&#8221;? And you have to be honest with yourself. I mean, the answer can be &#8220;no&#8221; sometimes. And that&#8217;s an acceptable answer.</p>
<p>You know, I had this one gentleman who sent me a very meaningful note on LinkedIn saying that he&#8217;d read my books and he saw what we were doing and then he started his own agency. And after three years, he closed it because he realized, he was like, &#8220;I just want to tell you, it&#8217;s not as easy as it looks.&#8221; And, you know, I appreciated the candor and I appreciated the fact that he was reflective, to be able to, you know, say that.</p>
<p>Because at the end of the day, yes, we&#8217;re agency owners and we have companies, but we&#8217;re also people. And you&#8217;re allowed to be multifaceted and multidimensional.</p>
<h3>Shama Hyder on tackling challenges in an evolving business landscape</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no magic bullet, but you know, all challenges require you to up your creativity. You know, how do we deal with challenges as humanity? We get more creative. It&#8217;s how it works. So, you&#8217;ve never tried outbound? Hey, maybe this is your opportunity. If you know you&#8217;ve been just sitting on your list for a long time, this is the time to dust it off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to rally the troops and get more consistent with it. You know, there&#8217;s no magic bullet, creativity doesn&#8217;t work that way. It is a little messy. You&#8217;re going to have to try new things. And I can tell you, again, being completely candid, we&#8217;re trying new things every day. We&#8217;re also making sure that we&#8217;re staying really consistent with the stuff that we know has worked. Right? And we&#8217;re not giving that up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new SharpSpring Agency Growth Series features an awesome curated lineup of the top influencers in digital marketing. We could not be more excited about the <a href="https://sharpspring.com/agency-acceleration-series-partners/">group of great minds</a> we were lucky enough to pull together to make this agency-focused series happen.</p>
<p>The free series is made up of 14 unique web sessions, all with a livestream Q&amp;A segment, and all focused on helping agencies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Sessions feature digital marketing superstars speaking candidly about the industry topics they know best and are most passionate about. And we want to make sure to share the love – so, in addition to providing recordings of the sessions and live Q&amp;As, we’ll also be posting key takeaways here following each session.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of our favorite insights from our Agency Growth Series session with agency owner, consultant and author Tom Martin.</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on “what is propinquity”</h3>
<p>Propinquity is a fancy scientific researcher word for proximity. It’s the number one determinant variable of the formation of future relationships. And this is based on about 100 years of social science research, mostly in the sort of marital relationship realm. And what it states is that the closer you are to someone in terms of physical or psychological, and I would now add virtual proximity, the more likely it is that you will form some sort of a relationship, romantic relationship, business relationship, etc.</p>
<p>And so it really is the scientific underpinning of the entire painless prospecting system that we&#8217;ve built here at Converse Digital in that we teach other people how to use it because it&#8217;s the science that makes the whole thing work.</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on the importance of propinquity</h3>
<p>As your agency is bumping into people and prospective clients, that client needs the opportunity to continually learn something new about you – your point of view, your capability, your thought process, how you think, etc., because it&#8217;s those new data points that ultimately they&#8217;ll hit a critical mass of things they like about you. And that&#8217;s what makes me want to actually contact you and potentially hire you. So that&#8217;s huge.</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on how to develop propinquity</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of ways to do it, you can be, you know, really well structured with your propinquity points. Like when the book [The Invisible Sale] came out, there were four or five key conferences that I felt potential readers of the book and potential clients of the agency attended and I made it a goal that I was going to speak at every one of those conferences &#8230; in the window where the book came out. And we even had the book release in that window so I was developing propinquity.</p>
<p>The other way you can do it, which I use a lot, is email. Which makes perfect sense for a SharpSpring webinar, and I talked about it in my webinar. How you can use email, especially automation type tools, etc., to not just create that proximity, but actually propinquity.</p>
<p>Because you can start to really educate that person about how you think, how your agency thinks, how it&#8217;s unique and why they should then, maybe, want to hire you.</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on how prospecting can be painless</h3>
<p>When you think about sales as prospecting you&#8217;re thinking like a hunter. I don&#8217;t do that. I think like the hunted. I want to be the prey. I want to be the person who&#8217;s hunted. The way it becomes painless is &#8212; I&#8217;ll use an example from very recently. When COVID hit everybody started doing virtual sales calls. Everybody discovered Zoom. We noticed that was a very topical thing, and we also noticed people, by and large, sucked at Zoom calls.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of simple technical issues, that – ‘Man, if you would just do this, this and this your quality of your meeting, the quality of how you present yourself, would put you head and shoulders above everybody else.’</p>
<p>So I spent a couple hours and I wrote a very simple blog post. We published it and it went out to our blog readers. It went to our social media, etc. That was probably, I don&#8217;t know, April. Since that time. I know for a fact I&#8217;ve had three new business leads coming off of that post.</p>
<p>Completely painless because the leads showed up in my inbox … and they&#8217;re already kind of sure they might want to do business with you. They at least think that you can probably deliver what they need. Now, whether or not they actually book you or hire you or go with someone else, there&#8217;s all kinds of things that get in the way of that. But you&#8217;re not out there trying to convince them that you&#8217;re the one that can do what they need. They&#8217;ve already convinced themselves, they&#8217;re just needing you to get on the phone, and it&#8217;s really more of a confirmation.</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on sales during the pandemic</h3>
<p>I think a couple of things, one is the same advice that I&#8217;ve always given – is to be a human. To not believe that it&#8217;s your goal to sell, but instead to help that prospective client make the right buying decision, even if it&#8217;s not your agency, you know? Really focus on building a relationship first, and if that turns into a transaction, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, maybe it will down the line, or a referral.</p>
<p>The second thing I would say, I think the single best piece of advice I could give you is to really get proficient at delivering a persuasive and compelling experience via video calls – WebEx, Zoom, whatever you&#8217;re using. Really stop and think about, ‘How is this call being received by the prospective client? How do we as an agency look? Do we look like we&#8217;re a team? Do we look like we&#8217;re a bunch of individuals?’</p>
<p>And I would get really, really good at it on a variety of platforms … If your agency uses Zoom, great, but that&#8217;s not going to help you if the client says &#8216;No, we use WebEx.&#8217;</p>
<h3>Tom Martin on how to find where your clients are hanging out</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re going to need to invest in some sort of social listening platform, preferably one that can take the URLs that people share and unpack them so that you can then export into a spreadsheet. For instance, if you exported my feed, you would see all the links to all the content that I&#8217;ve shared, let&#8217;s say, over the last six months to a year. And then you basically are sorting and grouping pivot tables … I&#8217;ve got my top 50 prospects, and by and large, they tend to share articles from Forbes, Fortune, AdAge, whatever. Okay?</p>
<p>Well, those are your propinquity points because if that&#8217;s where your known customer or prospect lives, chances are, birds of a feather flock together. There&#8217;s probably a lot of other people that look just like those folks that you don&#8217;t know that are also there and so that helps you understand not only where they are, but that they tend to ascribe value to that content.</p>
<p>And therefore, if you can get your content in there, not only A, can you be seen, but B, you might even get shared. Which again, now you&#8217;ve got some social proof because that&#8217;s basically a lightweight recommendation there.</p>
<p>The other way is just pay attention to your industry. Granted, conferences are largely virtual right now, but you ought to know what your major trade shows, your conferences are … It makes sense to try to find a way to show up at those, especially if you can show up in a way that is knowledge-based. A speaker, for instance, versus a trade show booth.</p>
