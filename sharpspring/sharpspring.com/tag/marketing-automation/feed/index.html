										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years marketing automation has become synonymous with growth. But what&#8217;s the current state of marketing automation in today&#8217;s business landscape? Many marketing professionals already incorporate some level of automation into their programs. Whether through a simple email drip series to introduce a new customer to the brand, or a full campaign to leverage customer browsing activity and serve up products they’ll love.</p>
<p>Since <u><a href="/features/">automation</a></u> can no longer be taken out of the conversation about marketing, we were curious to find out more. How exactly are agencies managing their needs and the needs of their clients using automated programs?</p>
<p>To learn more, we teamed up with <u><a href="https://ascend2.com/">Ascend2</a></u>, a leader in research-based marketing, to survey a panel of marketing professionals and marketing research subscribers on their current and projected use of marketing automation.</p>
<p>This survey represents the <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/">opinions of the 95 marketing professionals</a> who provide agency services. Of those surveyed, 58% held owner, partner, or C-level titles, 59% of the companies had fewer than 50 employees, and 43% said their primary marketing/sales focus was B2B.</p>
<h2>The Agency Marketer&#8217;s Perspective</h2>
<p>We asked about eight categories to learn more about marketer behavior. We’ll dive into a few of the highlights below but <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/"><u>download the full report</u></a> to get all the statistics to utilize in your own planning.</p>
<h3>Why Marketers Use Automation</h3>
<p>First off, we had to understand the why. Why are so many marketers leaning into automation?</p>
<p>A majority of the respondents chose streamlining marketing and sales efforts and minimizing manual tasks (43% and 36% respectively) as their main motivations. Not surprisingly, a huge <u><a href="/features/">benefit of automation</a></u> is being able to automate many repetitive, time-consuming tasks.</p>
<p>Improving customer engagement and improving customer experience were also high on the list, while some data optimization features rounded out the bottom three.</p>
<h3>Is Strategic Success Being Reached?</h3>
<p>Of course, implementing a revenue growth platform is one thing, but we wanted to know if the marketers using them were seeing results.</p>
<p>Only 2% of those surveyed claimed that marketing automation has been unsuccessful. The overwhelming majority told us that their efforts were at least somewhat successful if not stellar. While success metrics vary business to business, automation can help collect the data needed to show ROI more easily.</p>
<h3>Amplifying the Success of Automation Tools</h3>
<p>Now that we’d established that these tools had been successful, we wanted to know which features marketers were relying on to move the needle. This gave us insights not only into what agencies need to establish automations that deliver ROI, but also which features and services are most useful to users.</p>
<p>To see the breakdown of which efforts or tactics most amplified the success of their marketing, <u><a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/">download the full report</a>.</u></p>
<h3>Where is Automation Being Used?</h3>
<p>Marketing automation solutions can be used to optimize the entire marketing and sales process. And it was interesting to see that nearly eight in ten agencies use it mainly for one marketing channel (78%). More than half (53%) also use it for social media management.</p>
<p>The more sales-driven efforts such as sales funnel communications (24%) and account-based marketing (21%) are only used by about a quarter of the agencies surveyed. This signals big opportunities for growth and implementing new features in the coming year.</p>
<h3>Where Do Marketers Plan to Use Automation?</h3>
<p>Thinking to the future, we got into the year ahead by asking where companies plan on expanding automation capabilities moving forward.</p>
<p>From all the features listed, push notifications and SMS marketing has the lowest percentage of marketers looking to implement it in the upcoming year. If you’re looking to <u><a href="/blog/enhance-your-agencys-service-stack-grow-agency/">enhance your agency’s service stack</a></u>, these would make great areas of opportunity.</p>
<p>The number one feature by far (48%) shows that companies are ready to expand beyond the basics. Of course, as companies become more comfortable with automation basics like email, they get more confident in exploring the other features.</p>
<h3>Using Automation Tools to their Fullest Potential</h3>
<p>Revenue growth platforms can seem overwhelming at first. The sales and marketing process is complicated! Trying to house it all under one system for ease of use for everyone means that your tool might come with additions and features that are unfamiliar or don’t apply to your business plan just yet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that many customers are left with systems that feel underutilized. About 50% of those surveyed agreed that they did not think they were using their systems to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s important to know if customers feel they are using their revenue growth platforms to the fullest. If not, that gives automation platforms opportunities for <u><a href="/resources/">education and guides</a></u> so that customers can feel confident exploring tools and features.</p>
<h3>Significant Barriers to Use</h3>
<p>Since so many marketers felt they were not using their automation tools to their fullest potential, we wanted to understand what was stopping them.</p>
<p>Over one-third (34%) of agencies feel that they are not provided adequate tools such as training, resources, or a knowledge base, to utilize the solutions to their fullest extent.</p>
<p>This is an important point to keep in mind when shopping for a marketing automation solution. You’ll want to be sure that whatever system you choose has options for training and <u><a href="/resources/">access to resources</a></u> long after the onboarding period has ended.</p>
<h3>Extent of Technology Integration</h3>
<p>Integrating marketing automation into your full technology stack is key to delivering well-strategized campaigns. With integration of all sales and marketing tools, teams are better positioned to centralize data and use reporting to run optimized campaigns.</p>
<p>While over half (52%) of agencies claimed that their automation is either entirely or mostly integrated into their existing technology, you’re not alone if it’s not. Optimizing integration can be another great goal for the year ahead.</p>
<h2>Get the Full Report</h2>
<p>It’s obvious that marketers are ready to tackle automation head on in the coming years. Those agencies who have been implementing automation for their customers for a while seem eager to expand their offerings and utilize the tools at their fingertips.</p>
<p>This survey was put together for your use, <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/"><u>download the full report</u></a> to use it in your own marketing strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing in popularity, eBooks are relevant pieces of digital media that businesses use to drive all sorts of marketing goals. Developing the skillset for creating eBooks that convert is a powerful tool for any marketer. eBooks can serve as catalysts for passive income, lead magnets that help you market to your audience and resources that <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/create-value-in-b2b-markets/">add more value to your services</a>.</p>
<p>But the value of your eBook really depends on how well you have optimized it for conversions. Here are 9 simple tips to make sure you&#8217;re creating eBooks that convert to help drive your business goals.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">1. Pick the Right Topic </span></h2>
<p>Successful eBooks offer <a href="/blog/sharpspring-onboarding-content-strategy/">real value</a> to the audience, addressing a pain point and helping to solve a problem. But it’s not enough to pick an eBook topic that offers valuable information. It must also address a problem that people are willing to spend money on to fix.</p>
<p>Start by browsing the current Kindle ebooks available in your chosen category. Are they mostly paid or free? Are they getting a lot of purchases and positive reviews? Researching your market can help you decide if your ebook topic is worthwhile and profitable.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">2. Come Up With an Amazing Title</span></h2>
<p>Your title is an important element to help your ebook gain visibility and get conversions. The last thing you want is a generic title that blends in with the crowd. Take a look at these 3 eBooks listed on the Kindle Store, as an example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182372" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM.png" alt="" width="1099" height="761" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM.png 1099w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-300x208.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-768x532.png 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-1024x709.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All these eBook titles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are unique</li>
<li>Illustrate the value their eBook offers</li>
<li>Optimize for a specific keyword (“email marketing”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the time to carefully brainstorm different title versions that have all these elements. Especially if you’re publishing on Kindle, it’s important to identify keywords to target and include them in your title.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">3. Proper Structure for Creating eBooks that Convert</span></h2>
<p>The structure of your eBook is the most important aspect besides your title. When people shop for eBooks online, they’re often able to get a sneak peek of the table of contents:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182370" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store.png" alt="" width="1090" height="566" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store.png 1090w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-300x156.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-768x399.png 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-1024x532.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /></p>
<p>This offers more detail about the value your eBook will offer. So take your time to structure your ebook and create a detailed table of contents to help drive conversions.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">4. Write and Rewrite </span></h2>
<p>Once you have your eBook structured, you’re ready to write it. Your eBook doesn’t need to be long, but it should offer enough details and resources to answer all of your audience’s questions about your chosen topic. Start with a basic draft, then add in graphs, illustrations and links to secondary resources to offer more value. Perfect your eBook as a resource so you can confidently sell it to your audience.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">5. Create an Attractive Cover </span></h2>
<p>Unless you’re a professional graphic designer or you have one on your in-house marketing team, you’ll want to hire someone to create an attractive cover for your book. An unprofessional eBook cover will never drive conversions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182371" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM.png" alt="" width="949" height="654" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM.png 949w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM-300x207.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">6. Pick Your Publishing Platforms  </span></h2>
<p>The next step is to decide where you want your eBook to be published. You will likely publish it to your website — this is a good choice if you’re using the eBook as a lead magnet or simply don’t want to associate with third party platforms. If you want to get more visibility for your eBook, you can also publish it on a platform like Amazon Kindle, Kobo Books, the iBooks Store, etc.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">7. Format for EPub and Proofread</span></h2>
<p>When self publishing an eBook, be sure to properly format it for the platform you&#8217;ll be publishing on. You can’t simply upload a Word Doc containing your book. You&#8217;ll need to create a special file format with specific line spacing, indentations, headers, etc. You can always hire someone to do this for you. Either way, make sure you proofread your eBook after it’s been formatted for EPub to avoid any strange formatting issues before you publish.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">8. Price Strategically </span></h2>
<p>When you upload an eBook to your distribution platform and go through the publishing process, you’ll be asked to set a price. If you simply price based on what you want to earn, it will be very difficult to drive conversions. Instead you have to look at your direct competition and price strategically. Common eBook prices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$0.99</li>
<li>$2.99</li>
<li>$9.99</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also okay to offer your eBooks for free to encourage downloads and gain reviews. You can raise the price down the road.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">9. Market Effectively </span></h2>
<p>If you want to drive conversions for your eBook, you can’t simply publish and forget it. You need to actively promote it to build trust with your audience and attract interest in your product. Instead of blasting social media with “Buy my eBook!” posts, incorporate it subtly into your content. Reference it in a blog post, recommend it in a marketing email, etc. You can also offer exclusive discounts to leads as they move down your sales funnel, encouraging them to convert.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep on Optimizing </span></h2>
<p>With traditional books, there’s not much you can do to improve them short of publishing a new edition. With eBooks, you can constantly <a href="/blog/use-data-marketing/">optimize and update</a> your work to drive more conversions. Revamping your title, refreshing your cover, or adjusting your pricing could potentially improve your conversion rate significantly. Keep monitoring performance and making improvements to get the most out of eBooks for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve built a great website, you’re committed to telling your brand story and you want to take your lead generation efforts to the next level. While you might be doing everything right from an inbound marketing perspective, you still may not be seeing the results you were hoping for with a sign up form that converts leads. If your sign up forms aren’t getting filled out, the answer might not be changing up your tactics ー it could simply be a matter of redesigning your sign up forms to better convert leads.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for ways to optimize your forms for conversion, consider these five sign up design tips to improve user experience, maximize contact form conversions and create the best sign up forms to convert leads.</p>
<h2>Minimize Your Form Fields</h2>
<p>If your form is a wall of fields that ask too much information or take too much time to complete, users are unlikely to complete your sign up. The best sign up forms have a minimal number of forms and are simple to fill out. Studies of sign up design show that as the number of fields on a form increases, conversion rates decrease — a reduction from 11 fields to four fields saw as much as a <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/?__hstc=182168376.f69614d73b17927ba5f3be77d2ba3442.1567531021028.1576876288016.1577170020288.69&amp;__hssc=182168376.4.1577170020288&amp;__hsfp=4250418031">120% conversion increase</a>.</p>
<p>Your sign up fields need to be specific to your business needs. Regardless of the number of fields, don’t hesitate to ask for the business-critical information you need to drive conversions. While some more personal information, such as phone numbers, might lower your conversion rates in a wider trend sense, you might also find that your individual business sees more qualified leads by including this field. Be sure to test new fields until you identify which ones help you gain the most traffic.</p>
<h2>Make Sure Your Form Is Prominently Placed</h2>
<p>As the old saying goes, it’s all about location, location, location. When you’re laying out a landing page or other web page containing a form, make sure it’s located in the most visible and convenient location on the page. This sign up design tactic ensures that your web users are able to reach out to you when it’s on their mind based on the individual page’s user experience.</p>
<p>Your website footer is a great place to have a simple sign-up form. Keep customer experience (UX) best practices in mind and don’t add too much bulk to the footer if it’s going to dramatically impact your page length. If you’re following our sign up design tip for a minimalist form with only a few fields, you shouldn’t see much negative impact on UX. By including a form in the footer you’ll always know your website visitors have a way to get in touch with you quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>The Best Sign Up Forms Work on All Devices</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://wpforms.com/online-form-statistics-facts/">45% of form data</a> is submitted on a mobile device? The increasingly on-the-go nature of the IoT era reinforces that sign up design must be mobile-friendly to maximize conversions for both B2B and B2C companies.</p>
<p>The top mistake with mobile forms is that fields don’t display properly on vertically-oriented screens. Drop-downs tend to be more mobile friendly than text fields or radio buttons as they’re easier to complete on a touch screen. Use a top-alignment rather than horizontal-alignment to keep all fields visible on a vertical screen, and reduce scroll time and visual appeal with minimum field heights.</p>
<h2>Sign Up Design Matters</h2>
<p>When it comes to sign up design, there are specific graphic design tactics you can use to make sure your form stands out on the page. Encapsulation ー placing fields and buttons in a colored, outlined “capsule” — helps ensure they stand out from negative space and draw the user’s eye. Buttons are a critical element of any form and need to stand out clearly. If possible, use a contrasting accent color that highlights specific CTAS.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, graphic design decisions make your form stand out from the rest of your page, and your buttons stand out on your form. Provide adequate white space around your form to reduce visual noise. Resist the urge for vibrant colors, bold patterns, loud textures and too many fonts — your form needs to stand out, but also needs to look good on every device and remain consistent with your brand guidelines.</p>
<h2>Optimize Your CTAs</h2>
<p>A single word on your form can have a massive impact on conversion rates. According to <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/">research from Unbounce</a>, using “Submit” on your sign up button can decrease conversion by as much as 3%. More authoritative CTAs like “Download” and “Register” saw poor conversion rates and were considered “demanding” by audiences, while informal CTAs such as “Go” and “Click Here” saw better performance.</p>
<p>While your button text needs to effectively call your user to action, you don’t want to seem demanding. Keep your CTA buttons concise at no more than 3 short words. That said, those words can showcase your brand personality ー “Let’s Chat,” “Work with Us” and “Let’s Get Started” work toward conversation rather than demanding it. Test a few different variations to see what works best for your business.</p>
<h2>How to Build a Sign Up Form That Converts Leads</h2>
<p>Sign up forms are a critical element of marketing automation to support lead generation and nurture efforts. The best sign up forms are ones that are easy for your users to complete while gathering all of the information your team needs to qualify and convert leads. Testing and optimization are necessary on forms, as with most digital marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Your <a href="/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> suite should let you build forms that integrate directly with your CRM and email workflows to centralize all of these tactics in a single hub, and give you insight into which variations and which sign up forms are truly performing for your business.</p>
<p>Using sign up forms can be one of the best ways to connect with your customers and to build stronger relationships ー and it all starts with <em>your</em> sign up form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite what you may have heard, <a href="/features/email/">email</a> isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, the use of email messaging is on the rise and shows no sign of slowing down. As of 2021, there are more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/">3.7 billion email users</a> around the world, and that number is expected to grow to 4.4 billion by 2023. With statistics like that, it’s important to stay on top of email marketing trends to ensure that you are making the most out of your <a href="/blog/top-10-digital-marketing-kpis/">digital marketing</a> strategy.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that the very first emails were sent in the 1960s. However, email messaging did not become available for personal use until the early 1990s. Since then, email has become hugely popular and has paved the way for instant messaging and chatbots to come to life. With the technology sector constantly evolving, email marketing trends have changed over the years, too. In this article, you’ll learn about some of the leading email marketing strategies for 2021 and how to utilize them to grow your own business online.</p>
<h2>Customizing the User Experience</h2>
<p>Successful <a href="/blog/understanding-the-purpose-of-brand-guidelines/">brands</a> know what their customers want and effectively cater to their specific needs. By crafting personalized email marketing campaigns, you will have a much greater chance of enticing the recipient to make a purchase than if you simply sent out a generic email.</p>
<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/find-out-reasons-for-unsubscribing-with-a-quick-exit-survey/">33% of email users</a> will unsubscribe from an email list because they don’t want what is being offered. By gathering data and properly analyzing your findings, you can customize messages to specifically attract your target audience to engage based on where they are in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>You can start by creating a <a href="/blog/2020-tips-developing-buyer-personas/">buyer persona</a>. This is a fictional summarization of your ideal customer. Using the data that you have collected, you can determine the age range, location and even the buying habits of your target audience. Buyer personas can help you customize your marketing tactics to specific types of people. If you offer a wide range of products or services, it may be in your best interest to create multiple buyer personas.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished, you or your marketing team can then craft email messages that are designed to intrigue your target audience. You can even take into account where the recipient may be in the sales funnel. An email targeting new leads will be very different from someone already familiar with your brand.</p>
<p>For example, follow-up emails for abandoned shopping carts are a great way to customize the user experience. You can offer a hesitant shopper a discount or free shipping to entice them to complete their purchase.</p>
<h2>Building Interactive Emails</h2>
<p>One of the coolest new email marketing trends rolling over from 2019 is making emails more interactive. This can be done in several ways by incorporating elements such as quizzes, images, gifs or even games. You want to add anything fun that will entice the recipient to engage with the email. Putting your customers in a good mood will help boost your web traffic and revenue.</p>
<p>It can also help with building brand loyalty. If your email recipients are having fun reading and interacting with your emails, that means they will be more likely to look forward to receiving those emails. Also, they may even forward the message to a friend or spread awareness of your brand by word-of-mouth. This could lead to more people subscribing to your email list.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to make your messages more interactive. A big one for 2020 is the addition of <a href="/blog/5-big-trends-in-marketing-automation/">chatbots</a>. This type of AI technology allows your consumers to ask common questions and get answers quickly. For many folks, the downside to online shopping is that they can’t physically touch the product or see it in-person.</p>
<p>By providing an interactive chatbot that can answer their burning questions quickly and efficiently, your leads will be more likely to commit to the purchase than if they have to wait 24 hours for customer service to respond.</p>
<h2>Narrow Down Your Subscriber List</h2>
<p>Quality over quantity applies to email messaging, too. If you have a large subscriber list but many of the recipients never even open your messages, it’s time to narrow down that list.</p>
<p>For 2021, a smart email marketing trend to follow is to take the time to comb through your recipients, see which ones are the least engaged, and remove them from the list. This will ensure that only the people who are interested in your products or services will be receiving emails from now on. Building a tight-knit, loyal community is key to cultivating a solid online presence.</p>
<p>Not only should you narrow down your subscriber list, but you should also cut down the number of messages you send out. To avoid being labeled as spam, only send out emails at the appropriate times. This tactic plays back into your buyer persona and when your recipients are most likely to read emails.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Customers Data Private</h2>
<p>With approximately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">60% of consumers being uncomfortable</a> sharing their information with brands, data privacy is a key email marketing trend for 2021 and beyond. You should have a clear, concise privacy policy in place that your audience can access readily. It needs to be easy-to-read to avoid any confusion, as well.</p>
<p>This tactic will help to build trust, and it will also lead to a better system of data collection for your company. If your subscribers trust your company enough to allow you to collect certain types of data, that means they are more likely to make purchases and recommend your company to their friends and family. It also means that they will play a key role in helping you update your buyer personas as your company grows.</p>
<h2>Make Your Emails Compatible with Voice Interfaces</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is steadily on the rise, and in-home devices such as Siri and Alexa are becoming increasingly popular. People are beginning to check their emails using these kinds of devices, so you need to make sure that your email campaigns are compatible with the newest voice recognition software.</p>
<p>An article published by the BBC suggests that approximately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190416-smart-speakers-why-your-voice-is-a-major-battle-in-music">55% of Americans</a> will have some sort of voice-activated, smart device in their homes by 2022. If you get in the game now, you will be far ahead of many of your competitors by then.</p>
<p>This strategy also applies to mobile devices. <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/">55% of email users check their messages</a> on their smartphones. That number is going to continue to grow, meaning that your email messages need to be mobile-friendly. Mobile users are looking for attention-grabbing messages that have a fast page load speed. Links embedded into the messages also need to open quickly to avoid losing potential sales.</p>
<p>Pro tip: make your emails more <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/mobile-user-experience-trends-for-2020/">mobile-friendly</a> by condensing images. Full-size pictures and graphics are unnecessary and cause slow loading speeds. By condensing these elements, you will increase your chances of having viewers engage with your emails.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up: Email Marketing Trends for 2021</h2>
<p>Email communication isn’t dying, but your old email marketing strategies should be. It’s time to change the way you market to your subscribers by making your email campaigns more personalized, interactive, secure and accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve heard of marketing automation but never used it, chances are you’ve asked yourself this question at least once: “Is marketing automation right for me?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve created the perfect product or service, but how do you then entice customers to spend money on it? After all, if you don’t attract and retain the right customers, you won’t be very successful.</p>
<p>Today’s customers use a variety of devices for commerce, like smartphones, laptops, and desktops. They also access multiple media sources to find your product or service, such as social media, email, web searches, vlogs, and ad clicks.</p>
<p>Developing a strategy that encompasses everything from customer contact to customer experience in a seamless, pleasant way is the key to successful omni-channel marketing. So, where do you put your focus?</p>
<h2>What Is Omni-Channel Marketing?</h2>
<p>Omni-channel marketing analyzes customer behaviors and needs to determine the best solutions that lead to success. Step into your customers’ shoes to learn what makes their lives easier or their browsing experience simpler or more pleasant.</p>
<p>Our modern technological world can seem cold and unfeeling, and customers yearn for a more personal approach. Today’s <a href="/blog/5-reasons-your-omnichannel-marketing-needs-marketing-automation/">omnichannel marketing automation</a> strategies can provide your customers with this desired level of comfort.</p>
<p>From initial customer contact to billing and follow-up customer service, omni-channel marketing spans all levels of your organization. An effective plan will embrace all departments or channels and unify the message.</p>
<h2>How Do You Create an Omni-Channel Strategy?</h2>
<p>Consider the following actions as you design new <a href="/blog/7-ways-implement-omni-channel-strategy/">omni-channel strategies</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> &#8211; A complete overhaul of your marketing strategy is expensive and can be jarring to customers who don’t appreciate change. Start small based on customer feedback and address one issue at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate your customers&#8217; needs</strong> &#8211; If your website lacks a key component, like a store locator, solve that issue first by using different technologies that check their location, find the nearest store, and connect to GPS. If your customers are unfamiliar with your product, create a content blog that tells them why it’s useful.</li>
<li><strong>Look at your website</strong> &#8211; An objective evaluation of your website helps you see whether it flows well. Click on each link, perform searches, and check whether the customer can easily access and learn about your product.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention to statistics</strong> &#8211; Track the effectiveness of your campaigns by measuring each click and asking yourself how often it results in a sale. Narrowing your focus will save time and effort.</li>
<li><strong>Treat each customer uniquely</strong> &#8211; Your customers are not identical and creating different strategies to address each audience segment is key. Marketing automation tools can capture data and create customized messages for a more personal touch.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong> &#8211; Use your brand, logo, slogan and colors consistently throughout your media to enhance the customer experience. Be sure your site looks appealing across all devices and confirm that you&#8217;re sending the right message.</li>
<li><strong>Use all opportunities to connect</strong> &#8211; Keep in touch with customers on your email list with relevant content and calls to action. If they’re on the verge of a purchase, follow up with a note or incentive to nudge them to complete the sale.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why Is Omni-Channel Marketing Important?</h2>
<p>Focusing on your customer is critical to your company’s success and reputation, so account for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your bottom line</strong> &#8211; Paying close attention to your <a href="/blog/top-tips-for-tailoring-your-digital-customer-experience/">customers&#8217; experience</a> can help you generate up to 60% more profit than companies that simply sell products with no direction. Drawing people to your site and treating them well can pay huge dividends.</li>
<li><strong>Loyalty</strong> &#8211; A great strategy builds <a href="/blog/marketing-automation-customer-loyalty/">brand loyalty</a> as your happy customer will return for more purchases or services &#8212; and they’ll tell their friends. Enhance this loyalty through buyer profiles, customer segmentation, content specific to a buyer’s behavior, seamless flow across multiple devices, and customer support.</li>
<li><strong>Evolve</strong> &#8211; It would be wonderful if simply designing a product and website with good customer service were enough, but this ever-changing world dictates vigilance and change. Take a look at your traffic and return on investment every so often to find out where you can improve.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it real</strong> &#8211; Adding automation is advantageous, but make sure it’s not done at the expense of customers’ comfort and experience. Study, plan, and be prudent when choosing new strategies.</li>
</ol>
<h2>New Omni-Channel Marketing Trends for 2020</h2>
<p>While omni-channel marketing is not a new concept, it has taken on more importance of late. Today’s customers are more educated and conduct extensive research before buying a product, and companies need a way to stand out from the competition. Plus, COVID-19 continues to affect marketing and business, keeping customers at home and limiting their experiences to digital platforms as opposed to physical storefronts and ad displays.</p>
<p>Omni-channel marketing combines all customer interaction points, including retail stores, online sites, email, social media, and more, on any device customers use. It’s critical to focus on this entire customer experience while making it feel human.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Appeal to customer emotions</strong> &#8211; Known as customer intimacy, this strategy involves branding your product or service to create an emotional response in your customers. Study what triggers their behavior and write blogs or ads to address their needs.Employ relationships, current events and product uses to bring a personal touch and connection to your brand. Although it sounds counterintuitive, today’s automation software can bring your customers together by uniting them behind a cause or purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t forget retail stores</strong> &#8211; With the rise of technology and stay-at-home, it’s easy to focus only on emails and online sales, but people inherently crave social interaction. Don’t neglect the in-person stores as an option to connect with your customers.Part of the seamless interaction across your channels involves directing consumers to a retail store through <a href="https://www.storemapper.com/blog/how-to-add-a-store-locator-to-your-website/">store locators</a>, GPS directions and in-store promotions or giveaways. Conversely, if someone walks into your store, provide digital options to keep in touch, such as an email list sign-up, website reminders, check-ins, or social media sites.</li>
<li><strong>Use technology to manage your campaigns</strong> &#8211; <a href="/marketing-automation/">Marketing automation</a> software is sophisticated, combining artificial intelligence with your customer data to craft specific, personal written and digital communication that appeals to each customer.By using the software’s workflow, you can set it up to automatically send emails, texts, or other messages based on behaviors. The data gathered from customer profiles or spending habits can help you pinpoint what parts of your strategy are working and where you might want to focus on new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Explore new ways to deliver content</strong> &#8211; You might already have a content blog, but consider branching out to include a <a href="/blog/14-tips-hot-video-marketing-strategy/">video blog</a>, or vlog. Today’s on-the-go consumers don’t always have time to read a long article &#8212; no matter how engaging it is &#8212; so a vlog, or even better a subscribable YouTube channel, might fit the bill.While they’re waiting for their latte, for instance, they can push play and watch a snippet or two. This medium also offers opportunities to explore emotions because it stimulates more senses.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted ads</strong> &#8211; Consider exploring <a href="/blog/perfect-audience/">programmatic ads</a> that are based on consumer profiles or behaviors. These digitally sent ads are generated according to customer preferences, allowing you to speak personally to more members of your audience.Using real-time data, you can target the sale of a product to baby boomers and millennials alike, and both groups will feel as if you related only to them.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your customers</strong> &#8211; It’s one thing to attract new customers, but retaining them is an art form. Sure, you’ve already persuaded them to buy once, but a top-notch product and customer experience will keep them happy and lead to sustainable growth for your company.Customers are often inundated with information, and it’s important to <a href="/blog/gmail-predictive-unsubscribe/">keep their attention and engagement</a> with a long-term strategy. Keep creating fresh content and provide incentives for them to come back or spread the word that your product or service is the must-have brand.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Time to Act</h2>
<p>Omni-channel marketing is a wonderful method to unify your workforce and customers into a single mission. A well-thought-out strategy is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Knowing your customers is crucial, because they ultimately drive the forces and folks that will keep your business thriving. Using one or more techniques can be the difference between building your business and struggling to attract new clients.</p>
<p>Remember, there is <a href="https://www.customerexperienceupdate.com/2020/omnichannel/">no one-size-fits-all strategy</a>. These are good guidelines, but ultimately, your specific industry and product will dictate the direction you should follow.</p>
<p>Marketing automation software and consultants can guide you through the process, but often the best decisions come down to your gut feelings and personal connections.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="list-unstyled list-chevron">
<p>If you work in marketing, you probably hear a lot about optimizing the customer experience, tracking buyer journeys and identifying decision-making factors and/or paths to purchase. But what about developing buyer personas?</p>
<p>You might be trying to identify key points to offer marketing liaisons or better understand when a sales team needs to get involved in nurturing a lead to conversion. Before you reach out and ask potential customers to trust you, you need to demonstrate that you understand who they are and what they want. And effectively developing buyer personas can help you do just that.</p>
<p>Buyer personas are fictionalized profiles of individual ideal customers, rooted in data from your existing successes. Using these models of the ideal customer, you’ll be able to better target your ads and hone your messaging to suit specific needs and convert leads into loyal customers.</p>
<p>In this blog, we outline everything you need to know about developing buyer personas to fine tune your <a href="/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> and digital marketing strategy.</p>
<h4>Buyer Persona Statistics</h4>
<p>It will take some initial thought and effort to properly build out detailed buyer personas, but the results will more than justify the time spent on the front end. Don’t believe us? Just check out this selection of buyer persona statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.itsma.com/importance-of-developing-effective-personas/">82%</a> of companies using personas improved their value proposition.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.madmarketer.com/topics/tips-and-tricks/articles/416688-make-2016-year-create-use-buyer-personas-drive.htm">71%</a> of companies that exceed lead generation and revenue goals have documented buyer personas.</li>
<li>Using buyer personas in the web design process helps improve usability anywhere from<a href="https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/content-marketing/science-building-buyer-personas/"> 2 times &#8211; 5 times</a><u>.</u></li>
<li>Behaviorally-targeted ads are<a href="https://www.singlegrain.com/blog-posts/content-marketing/science-building-buyer-personas/"> twice as effective</a> as general ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stats don’t lie! By building personas and using a more personalized approach to your marketing, you can become more effective in your targeting and work more efficiently to generate qualified leads.</p>
<h4>How Many Buyer Personas Should You Create?</h4>
<p>Just as there is no single path to purchase, it’s highly unlikely that a single buyer persona will cover your entire ideal customer base. In most cases, three to five buyer personas are required to adequately capture a full audience.</p>
<p>For example, let’s consider a real estate agent who primarily lists homes under a $500,000 value. This real estate agent needs to target a few different groups to keep her business going ─ current homeowners in the area that might be interested in selling their homes and potential buyers for these homes.</p>
<p>That’s not quite enough detail to do any effective marketing, so our realtor will have to drill down further while developing personas. She might have a couple of personas within each of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current homeowners with children who might be looking to sell their homes for more space</li>
<li>Families selling a home for a senior parent or relative</li>
<li>“Flippers” looking to buy and sell homes as an investment opportunity</li>
<li>First-time home buyers looking for a starter home</li>
<li>Empty nesters looking to buy a smaller home and downsize</li>
</ul>
<p>With these personas in mind, our real estate agent can think seriously about how to speak to each specific persona based on their mindset: for example, the “flippers” will have a very different set of needs from the first-time home buyers.</p>
<p>To figure out how many buyer personas you need to create for your business, look at your current customer base and your competitors’ customers, and try to identify commonalities in demographics, reasons for purchase and common pain points.</p>
<h4>Steps for Developing Buyer Personas</h4>
<p>When you’re considering your buyer personas, look at as many details as possible. You can start with the five ‘Ws’ of basic investigation to drill down and find your personas:</p>
<h4>Who</h4>
<p>Consider all of the relevant demographic information that can help you target your audience. Age, gender, race, education, geographic location, socioeconomic background, marital status and number of children can all inform the mindset your personas are bringing to their purchase decisions.</p>
<p><a href="/features/sharpspring-social/">Social media</a> and search engines will typically let you target your advertising by demographic factors like these, as well as interests and behaviors. For example, let’s look at <a href="https://www.honest.com/">The Honest Company</a>, which makes natural baby and beauty products. Their primary target is likely women with children, but if you consider further, you’ll identify less obvious key demographics.</p>
<p>Millennial women in urban areas are typically more interested in natural products and social responsibility than older women in rural areas. The products aren’t the cheapest on the market, meaning their target market needs to be more affluent and willing to pay for natural and organic products.</p>
<h4>What</h4>
<p>When developing buyer personas, it’s important to think about the pain points your audiences might be experiencing and understand how you can help. Knowing the mindset and background your personas are bringing to the purchase decision will help you tailor your brand even more specifically. Make sure that your product and services actually meet the needs of your target personas.</p>
<h4>When</h4>
<p>You also need to understand how quickly your buyers need their pain points solved. Some products and services lend themselves to extreme urgency, while others require longer sales cycles and additional touchpoints to make a decision.</p>
<p>If your product is time-sensitive or solves an immediate need, you’re more likely to take on urgency-based messaging. If you’re more about making life easier in the long term, you’ll likely need to do a bit more persuading.</p>
<h4>Where</h4>
<p>The “where” in your <a href="/blog/9-easy-tips-for-building-out-your-buyer-personas/">buyer persona</a> doesn’t necessarily refer to geographic location. It’s more about considering where your personas are in the buyer’s journey. Are they aware that there’s a product that can help them solve this specific pain point? Are they considering specific factors between you and your competitors? Are they approaching a decision and looking to seal the deal?</p>
<p>Understanding where your audiences fall in the buyer’s journey when they discover your brand will not only help you while developing buyer personas, but also while executing your ongoing content strategy. You should be able to serve content for each stage of your sales funnel, nurturing leads from one stage to the next.</p>
<p>If buyers are coming to your brand already in the consideration stage, too much awareness-level content can come across as condescending or just generally not useful.</p>
<h4>Why</h4>
<p>This is a question you should be able to answer uniquely for each audience segment. When it comes to buyer personas, you need to be able to address how your product is relevant to each individual. This is where your value proposition comes in.</p>
<p>Your value proposition should be specifically written with your buyer personas in mind, and your messaging for each persona should be derived from this value proposition. This ends up becoming your ultimate call-to-action for your brand: it outlines the reasons customers should choose you and delivers the promise of what to expect.</p>
<h4>Developing Buyer Personas Isn’t a “One-and-Done” Affair</h4>
<p>Buyer personas are meant to represent living, breathing people as specifically as possible. In order to make the most of your personas, regularly assess the results of your campaigns, the demographic information of your leads and ask your existing customers what brought them to your brand over the competition. Regularly fine-tuning your personas will set you up for ongoing marketing success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite what you may have heard, <a href="/features/email/">email</a> isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, the use of email messaging is on the rise and shows no sign of slowing down. As of 2021, there are more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/">3.7 billion email users</a> around the world, and that number is expected to grow to 4.4 billion by 2023. With statistics like that, it’s important to stay on top of email marketing trends to ensure that you are making the most out of your <a href="/blog/top-10-digital-marketing-kpis/">digital marketing</a> strategy.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that the very first emails were sent in the 1960s. However, email messaging did not become available for personal use until the early 1990s. Since then, email has become hugely popular and has paved the way for instant messaging and chatbots to come to life. With the technology sector constantly evolving, email marketing trends have changed over the years, too. In this article, you’ll learn about some of the leading email marketing strategies for 2021 and how to utilize them to grow your own business online.</p>
<h2>Customizing the User Experience</h2>
<p>Successful <a href="/blog/understanding-the-purpose-of-brand-guidelines/">brands</a> know what their customers want and effectively cater to their specific needs. By crafting personalized email marketing campaigns, you will have a much greater chance of enticing the recipient to make a purchase than if you simply sent out a generic email.</p>
<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/find-out-reasons-for-unsubscribing-with-a-quick-exit-survey/">33% of email users</a> will unsubscribe from an email list because they don’t want what is being offered. By gathering data and properly analyzing your findings, you can customize messages to specifically attract your target audience to engage based on where they are in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>You can start by creating a <a href="/blog/2020-tips-developing-buyer-personas/">buyer persona</a>. This is a fictional summarization of your ideal customer. Using the data that you have collected, you can determine the age range, location and even the buying habits of your target audience. Buyer personas can help you customize your marketing tactics to specific types of people. If you offer a wide range of products or services, it may be in your best interest to create multiple buyer personas.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished, you or your marketing team can then craft email messages that are designed to intrigue your target audience. You can even take into account where the recipient may be in the sales funnel. An email targeting new leads will be very different from someone already familiar with your brand.</p>
<p>For example, follow-up emails for abandoned shopping carts are a great way to customize the user experience. You can offer a hesitant shopper a discount or free shipping to entice them to complete their purchase.</p>
<h2>Building Interactive Emails</h2>
<p>One of the coolest email marketing trends is making emails more interactive. This can be done in several ways by incorporating elements such as quizzes, images, gifs or even games. You want to add anything fun that will entice the recipient to engage with the email. Putting your customers in a good mood will help boost your web traffic and revenue.</p>
<p>It can also help with building brand loyalty. If your email recipients are having fun reading and interacting with your emails, that means they will be more likely to look forward to receiving those emails. Also, they may even forward the message to a friend or spread awareness of your brand by word-of-mouth. This could lead to more people subscribing to your email list.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to make your messages more interactive. A big one for 2021 is the addition of <a href="/blog/5-big-trends-in-marketing-automation/">chatbots</a>. This type of AI technology allows your consumers to ask common questions and get answers quickly. For many folks, the downside to online shopping is that they can’t physically touch the product or see it in-person.</p>
<p>By providing an interactive chatbot that can answer their burning questions quickly and efficiently, your leads will be more likely to commit to the purchase than if they have to wait 24 hours for customer service to respond.</p>
<h2>Narrow Down Your Subscriber List</h2>
<p>Quality over quantity applies to email messaging, too. If you have a large subscriber list but many of the recipients never even open your messages, it’s time to narrow down that list.</p>
<p>For 2021, a smart email marketing trend to follow is to take the time to comb through your recipients, see which ones are the least engaged, and remove them from the list. This will ensure that only the people who are interested in your products or services will be receiving emails from now on. Building a tight-knit, loyal community is key to cultivating a solid online presence.</p>
<p>Not only should you narrow down your subscriber list, but you should also cut down the number of messages you send out. To avoid being labeled as spam, only send out emails at the appropriate times. This tactic plays back into your buyer persona and when your recipients are most likely to read emails.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Customers Data Private</h2>
<p>With approximately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">60% of consumers being uncomfortable</a> sharing their information with brands, data privacy is a key email marketing trend for 2021 and beyond. You should have a clear, concise privacy policy in place that your audience can access readily. It needs to be easy-to-read to avoid any confusion, as well.</p>
<p>This tactic will help to build trust, and it will also lead to a better system of data collection for your company. If your subscribers trust your company enough to allow you to collect certain types of data, that means they are more likely to make purchases and recommend your company to their friends and family. It also means that they will play a key role in helping you update your buyer personas as your company grows.</p>
<h2>Make Your Emails Compatible with Voice Interfaces</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is steadily on the rise, and in-home devices such as Siri and Alexa are becoming increasingly popular. People are beginning to check their emails using these kinds of devices, so you need to make sure that your email campaigns are compatible with the newest voice recognition software.</p>
<p>An article published by the BBC suggests that approximately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190416-smart-speakers-why-your-voice-is-a-major-battle-in-music">55% of Americans</a> will have some sort of voice-activated, smart device in their homes by 2022. If you get in the game now, you will be far ahead of many of your competitors by then.</p>
<p>This strategy also applies to mobile devices. <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/">55% of email users check their messages</a> on their smartphones. That number is going to continue to grow, meaning that your email messages need to be mobile-friendly. Mobile users are looking for attention-grabbing messages that have a fast page load speed. Links embedded into the messages also need to open quickly to avoid losing potential sales.</p>
<p>Pro tip: make your emails more <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/mobile-user-experience-trends-for-2020/">mobile-friendly</a> by condensing images. Full-size pictures and graphics are unnecessary and cause slow loading speeds. By condensing these elements, you will increase your chances of having viewers engage with your emails.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up: Email Marketing Trends for 2021</h2>
<p>Email communication isn’t dying, but your old email marketing strategies should be. It’s time to change the way you market to your subscribers by making your email campaigns more personalized, interactive, secure and accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to setting up a solid company strategy, one of the key elements is choosing a pricing model for your business that will bring you maximum profitability.</p>
<p>There are several ways to go about setting up your own pricing structure, and each one has a direct effect on how you sell your products or services and who you bring onto your team. Two common pricing models for businesses are the retainer model and the lump sum model. Read on to find out more about both model types, as well as to discover helpful tips for choosing a pricing model for your business that will lead to increased conversions and revenue in 2020.</p>
<h2>Retainer Model</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retainer-fee.asp">retainer</a> is an agreement between the client and your company for the client to pay you a set fee before any work is done. This negotiable, pre-paid amount is determined by a set time or a set number of deliverables/services.</p>
<p>A time-based retainer model is set up when your client agrees to be billed for a set number of hours each month. For example, if your client purchases 40 hours of work for the month at $100 per hour, you will make $4,000 from this single client. Typically, unused hours do not roll over into the next month. However, you can add a clause to your contract that allows for this if you so choose.</p>
<p>Under a service-based retainer model, your company agrees to produce a set number of deliverables each month for the client. For example, if you run a <a href="/agency/">digital marketing agency</a>, your client could pre-pay for a social media management package. Packages could include creating posts, scheduling posts, providing images, cross-posting across several social media platforms and more. With this type of model, it’s your job to decide what services you will offer in each tier and how much you will charge per month.</p>
<p>Some clients, especially larger companies, prefer using the retainer model for budgeting reasons. This method can help them plan ahead financially by eliminating unexpected charges. However, start-ups and smaller businesses may be wary of agreeing to a retainer plan due to more limited funding. It can be a daunting thought to drop thousands of dollars for time that may not be used, or services that may not be necessary at the moment.</p>
<p>Agencies with longstanding relationships with larger clients will see the best results from using a retainer model pricing system. This method can also work well for companies that are capable of producing a large volume of work in a month.</p>
<h3>Retainer Model Pros:</h3>
<p>The fee is paid up front, which gives you the peace of mind of having a guaranteed income. It’s an attractive model for well-established businesses, and it allows you to grow your company at a faster pace.</p>
<h3>Retainer Model Cons:</h3>
<p>In general, this method of pricing can be a difficult sell to new clients and smaller businesses. It may also not be as profitable if you choose the route of offering service-based retainers. This is because projects may take more time than expected, which can lead to a reduction in profitability.</p>
<h2>Lump Sum Model</h2>
<p>As with the retainer method, there are several types of lump sum pricing strategies. They can be project-based, performance-based, value-based and hourly. Each one is paid upon the completion of services/deliverables at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The project-based lump sum method is one of the most popular pricing models for agencies. It’s actually one of the simplest, too! You simply charge the client a lump sum fee based on the entire project at hand. For example, if you run a social media marketing company, you may charge a flat rate for managing a Facebook ad campaign. These projects don’t have to be huge either. Take a graphic design agency, for example. They could offer an entire branding package for a total lump sum, and also offer a logo-only deal for a separate lump sum. This allows an agency to cater services to better suit client needs. It may be a good idea to incorporate this pricing method for new clients so that they can try out your services before committing to a long-term business relationship.</p>
<p>Similar to working on commission, the performance-based pricing structure will have you being paid in a lump sum based on how well your work performed. For example, a digital marketing company that offers copywriting services could be paid based on how many sales their copy produced by the end of the month. This is a very lucrative structure that’s easy to scale quickly. However, if your work doesn’t perform well for any reason, you may not get paid at all.</p>
<p>If your company has a powerful reputation in your industry, you could benefit greatly from using the value-based pricing model. The client will pay you a lump sum based on the expertise you bring to their company. If your business is the only one that can present a solution to the client’s problems, then you are offering a high-value service. The downside is that this pricing model depends solely on the current demand for your specialized services. This can sometimes be difficult to sell.</p>
<p>The final lump sum method that you could choose to incorporate into your business is the old-fashioned hourly rate. This ends up being paid out at the end of the month and is a straight-forward method that clients understand. As the simplest pricing model, all you need to do is set your hourly rate and bill your clients according to how many hours you took to complete their service or project. For example, a post-production company may charge $300 per hour for video editing. Completing 10 hours of editing time will have you making $3,000 from that particular client. This is an easy sell to clients because it gives them more of a breakdown of what they are paying for.</p>
<h3>Lump Sum Pros:</h3>
<p>This type of billing system is typically much easier to sell to a new client. It’s also a great way to establish a good business relationship between your company and theirs.</p>
<h3>Lump Sum Cons:</h3>
<p>With lump sum payments, you will not receive payment until the end of the month. If you have chosen the performance-based method, you may not get paid at all. This type of pricing structure is also more difficult to scale than the retainer model.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up Pricing Models for Businesses</h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Is Intent the New Experience?</h2>
<p>Intent-based marketing is a digital approach focused on meeting specific needs based on particular questions being asked online.</p>
<p>When thinking about ways to reach your audience and meet their needs, you’ve likely considered your overall customer experience, the <a href="/blog/sharpspring-visual-workflow-builder/">buyer’s journey</a> for your products and what <a href="/blog/how-to-write-persuasive-content/">content</a> might be useful to each prospect as they work up to making a decision.</p>
<p>What you might not have considered &#8212; and where intent-based marketing comes into play &#8212; are the opportunities available to reach users who are looking for a specific item or piece of information at a specific point in time.</p>
<h2>Intent-Based Marketing Theory</h2>
<p>When thinking about intent-based marketing and why it’s important, the concept to understand is that it makes more sense to cater your content and tactical efforts to specific user intentions and mindsets based on trigger keywords and phrases.</p>
<p>Users conduct searches for a variety of reasons and it’s up to you to understand those reasons and motivations to optimize your digital marketing strategy.</p>
<p>The difference between intent-based marketing and experience-focused marketing is the ability to reach users at their specific stage of the buyer’s journey. You minimize the risk of accidentally serving awareness-stage content to users who are already prepared to make a decision. Both approaches are SEO-heavy and will rely on robust content <a href="/features/automation/">marketing automation</a>, but with intent-based marketing you can focus on creating your sales and marketing efforts on specific goals.</p>
<h3>Navigational Intent</h3>
<p>Users will sometimes search for a brand name rather than navigating directly to the website. Think about how many times you’ve typed “Amazon” or “Facebook” into the browser address bar, knowing that if the URL doesn’t autocomplete, the site you’re looking for will be in the first few results. These users are looking for a specific site and attempting to reach it.</p>
<p>You might think that navigational intent wouldn’t present many opportunities for intent-based marketing tactics, but that’s actually not the case. Branded keywords are often taken for granted, so the chances are that most of your competitors aren’t bidding highly on their own names. <a href="https://justmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Conquesting-White-Paper.pdf">Conquesting</a> is a paid search tactic involving bidding on keywords such as competitor brand names and product names. This then positions your name in navigational search results as an alternative for users intending to find those specific brands.</p>
<p>If you plan to use conquesting as a tactic, make sure your landing page meta description specifically and concisely positions you as a better alternative to the branded search query.</p>
<h3>Informational Intent</h3>
<p>Informational intent is a user’s basic search looking for information or an answer to a question. Most informational searches aren’t directly related to a purchase transaction. Think about your recent search history. Odds are, most searches you’ve conducted have been with informational intent, such as “calories in an apple,” “Star Wars cast,” “capital of Montana” or “Chesterfield native plants.” These types of searches are most common and not very likely to lead to a purchase.</p>
<p>Informational intent is the best opportunity to leverage awareness-level content for your brand. Consider the questions that your ideal customers might be researching that aren’t necessarily related to a purchase and create top of funnel content around those topics. As a completely random example, if your product were, let’s say, a <a href="/features/">marketing automation platform</a>, you might write blogs about “marketing tactics,” or “how to market to Millennials.”</p>
<h3>Consumer Research Intent</h3>
<p>Similar to informational intent, consumer research intent is mostly about weighing options in the late awareness and early consideration stages of the buyer’s journey.</p>
<p>These searches might be for reviews, product features and pricing information about a variety of brands before making a purchase decision. Words like “cheapest,” “best” and “reviews” are typically in these search queries, so build content that includes long-tailed keywords.</p>
<p>Borrowing from some of our previous examples, let’s say you’re considering going to a movie this weekend. You might have started with an informational search like “Star Wars cast” and learned that one or two of your favorite actors are in the movie. The consumer research intent search will help you decide whether or not you want to go see the movie. This might include searching “Star Wars reviews” so you can read opinions from other movie-goers (reviews) and professional critics (influencers) to help you decide if you want to head out to the theater this weekend or would rather wait to stream it later on.</p>
<h3>Purchase Transaction Intent</h3>
<p>This stage of intent-based marketing is the most urgent, using phrases that indicate a user is ready to make a purchase. This includes queries such as “near me,” “open now,” “today” or “delivery.” Leveraging <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">Google My Business</a> and other listing sites such as <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> will help you reach users with this sense of urgency looking to make a purchase immediately.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’re a restaurant, you’ll likely want to be on Yelp, UberEats and GrubHub to ensure that customers can taste what you have to offer the minute they search for “best burgers near me.”</p>
<p>Continuing our example, once you’ve found reviews and decided that the newest Star Wars movie is worth seeing, you’re likely ready to buy some tickets. You’ll probably search “Star Wars showtimes near me” or something similar, and you might even buy tickets for the next showtime online through a ticketing site or your local theater.</p>
<h2>Putting Intent-Based Marketing to Work</h2>
<p>The cornerstone of effective intent-based marketing is ensuring a robust SEO and <a href="/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> strategy. Working to meet specific long-tailed search queries at various stages of the buyer’s journey is a lot easier if you have a clear understanding of what your ideal customer is actually searching for when they find your product and how their mindset impacts their search intent. Hitting someone with informational intent will be put off by transaction-based messaging, while someone ready to make a purchase will be frustrated if they can’t quickly and easily place their order.</p>
<p>Accurate assessment open rates, click-through rates and lead sources as part of your overall marketing efforts can help you inform your keyword research and to develop an intent-based marketing plan. If you use this strategy effectively, you’ll be able to acquire more qualified leads quickly, with less effort than a full experience-based customer journey.</p>
<p>Marketers who take advantage of intent based marketing can leverage this as a competitive edge over the rest of the industry. Be on the lookout for opportunities to optimize your intent-based marketing strategy with SharpSpring’s automated marketing system.
