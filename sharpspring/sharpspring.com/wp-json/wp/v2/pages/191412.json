In these cases, we will collect information provided to us through the form or questionnaire used to make the request, or the contact or other information provided at a trade show or industry event. The information is provided directly and voluntarily by the individual. Depending on the circumstances, the information may include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First and Last Name<\/li>\n<li>Name of the business<\/li>\n<li>Email address<\/li>\n<li>Street address, city, state, province and\/or country<\/li>\n<li>Telephone number<\/li>\n<li>Website URL<\/li>\n<li>Social Media Handles<\/li>\n<li>Mobile Number<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"list-unstyled list-chevron\">\n<p>We collect this data for sales and marketing purposes to allow us to respond to a request from a lead so that we may provide information about our Service.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer Representative Data<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a Customer has purchased the Service, we create an account on our Platform, in the name of the Customer. The Customer has the ability to create one or several accounts.

Any information that the user chooses to disclose by means of such features may become public information.<\/p>\n<p>SharpSpring is unable to exercise control over this information once the user has made it public. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal data by means of such features, and you are solely responsible for any uses or misuse of such information.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publicly Available Information<\/span><br \/>\nWe supplement information that we receive directly from the user or the user\u2019s equipment with additional information that is available from public sources, in public records, or other publicly available databases or from information that the user has made public, for example, in tweets or Facebook posts.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment Information<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a Customer pays for the Service, we collect the method of payment, date and amount of the payment. If the Customer pays with a credit card, this information is transmitted directly to our payment processor, and we do not retain the detail of the payment information other than the Transaction ID number. After payment card information is entered, we do not have access to payment card information and disclaim any liability for any loss or compromise of payment card information. When you make a payment, you agree to terms of our payment processor.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of an ongoing relationship, we retain information about the Customer\u2019s payment history as necessary for the administration of the Customer account.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communication from Users<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a visitor or lead completes an online form, visits our website or other areas of our Platform (for example on social media), or when a user otherwise contacts us, by email, phone or text, we automatically collect and store certain information about that user and the user\u2019s activities, as we receive from such user, for example:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-unstyled list-chevron\">\n<ul>\n<li>The user\u2019s name and contact information.<\/li>\n<li>Information that the user provides to us.<\/li>\n<li>The user\u2019s company information, if any.<\/li>\n<li>The nature of the communication.<\/li>\n<li>The purpose of the interaction, and the action we took in response to the user\u2019s inquiry or request.<\/li>\n<li>Any action the user takes upon receipt of such communication (for example, whether the user registers to attend an event that we offer, or request to receive documentation).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>The information collected in connection with each type of interaction is retained so that SharpSpring and each user can continue interaction with the requestor for marketing and sales purpose and the promotion of our Service.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communications to Users<\/span><br \/>\nUnless we are prohibited by applicable law from using cookies and a user has not otherwise consented to our use of cookies, we insert cookies in some of our correspondence with users.<\/p>\n<p>In that case, when we send an email message to a user, our message contains images or links, which when viewed or clicked, will register an event with us that allows us to know whether the user has accessed or declined to open our message. This action may also store a cookie which will allow us to count unique clicks or visits and potentially track the recipient.<\/p>\n<p>This information is needed for our legitimate business purposes, because it helps us understand how the individual reacts to our communications and limit the amount and nature of information provided. We believe that such means are fair, lawful, and proportional to the legitimate interest and needs of our business, and that our methodology fairly addresses each user\u2019s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.<\/p>\n<p>The information is collected in connection with our marketing efforts and is retained so that we can continue or elect to stop interaction with the lead.<\/p>\n<p>We do not want to intrude in your busy life or waste your time. If at any time you wish that we cease to communicate with you, please contact us as indicated in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section, or take advantage of the unsubscribe link that you will find in any of our written electronic communications.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surveys and Contests<\/span><br \/>\nFrom time-to-time, we invite users to participate in surveys or contests. Participation is voluntary. These surveys are organized for the purposes of our marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>When a user participates, we request certain personal data such as name and email address. This is necessary to ensure that responses are categorized properly and are not duplicated<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the nature of the survey or contents, we also use this information to send the survey results to the participants, or, if applicable, to notify contest winners and award prizes.<\/p>\n<p>We use the information obtained from these surveys and contests in aggregate form, for analytics purposes, to understand our market, to monitor site traffic or app usage, or to modify our Platform or our Service to meet the needs or interests of users.<\/p>\n<p>If we use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys, the information collected by the service provider may be subject to both the service provider\u2019s privacy policy and SharpSpring\u2019s. We will provide information about the applicable privacy policies with the Survey rules and will seek your explicit consent to these rules when required by law. You should read the terms of the survey or contest to understand the extent to which the service provider is allowed to use or reuse the information collected.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media<\/span><br \/>\nOur Platform offers integrations with third-party social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. These services collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Platform. They may set a cookie to enable their features to function properly. Social media features and widgets are hosted by a third party or directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Your use of these services is optional. If you elect to use them, you will be deemed to have expressly consented to the collection of personal data by these services according to their terms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information we Obtain from Third Parties<\/span><br \/>\nWe receive information from third party data providers including directories. In some cases, such as LinkedIn, the information has manifestly been made public by the individuals who posted their profile on LinkedIn, and we assume that the individuals no longer have a privacy interest in such information, and it can be used for the legitimate interest of SharpSpring in learning about potential Customers.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email Accounts<\/span><br \/>\nUsers may opt-in to use features of the Platform which regularly collect and store the contents of emails from their email accounts, which are hosted by third-party email service providers. This is done for the purpose of providing advanced features of the Platform and is only done at the user\u2019s express direction.<\/p>\n<p>In order to provide these features, the Platform must authenticate with the user\u2019s third-party email accounts. When possible, this is done using OAuth.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the Platform will use OAuth to securely authenticate with a user\u2019s particular email account. Once authenticated, the OAuth authentication, or \u201cbearer\u201d token, is encrypted and stored, and is used on subsequent requests to prove authentication. When OAuth is not possible, we encrypt and store the user\u2019s third-party email account credentials, and thereafter use them to securely authenticate with the third-party email service.<\/p>\n<p>Access to email account authentication tokens and credentials (where applicable), the keys to decrypt this data, and user email content, is limited to only employees who need access to support and develop the Platform and only within the scope of their job responsibilities. The user\u2019s authentication tokens or credentials, and email data, is never shared with third-parties.<\/p>\n<p>For users who authorize and use OAuth with their Gmail account through Google, the use of data obtained through the Platform will comply with Google\u2019s additional Restricted Scopes requirements that are listed in the Google API Services: User Data Policy. The details of the this policy can be found at: <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/terms\/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes\">https:\/\/developers.google.com\/terms\/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes.<\/a> As this policy is subject to change based on the needs of Google, it is recommended that users regularly check on updates to the policy at the above attached web address.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5 class=\"heading\">How Information is Collected.<\/h5>\n<p>The information is collected through several different means described below. We believe that such means are fair, lawful, and proportional to the legitimate interest and needs of our business, and that our methodology fairly addresses each user\u2019s legitimate rights and expectations in view of the context and purpose for the collection and use of the information collected.<\/p>\n<p>However, please be assured that we do not want to intrude in your busy life or waste your time. If at any time you wish that we cease any form of collection or processing of information about you, please contact us as indicated in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Provided by the User\u2019s Device<\/span><br \/>\nSome information is provided automatically by the user\u2019s device or browser. This includes, for example, browser and device version information.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Information Obtained when a User Downloads and Uses our App.<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a user downloads and uses ourApp, we may track and collect usage data, such as the date and time the App accesses our servers, and what screens or pages were accessed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct Contact by the User<\/span><br \/>\nSome information is provided directly by the user. This includes, for example, information provided by a user:<\/p>\n<div class=\"list-unstyled list-chevron\">\n<ul>\n<li>When requesting information about one of our products or services.<\/li>\n<li>By completing a questionnaire, a form or a survey.<\/li>\n<li>When placing a call to us and requesting assistance from us.<\/li>\n<li>By visiting with us at an industry event.<\/li>\n<li>By registering to attend a seminar or webinar.<\/li>\n<li>By requesting a copy of a newsletter or white paper.<\/li>\n<li>When subscribing to marketing communications.<\/li>\n<li>When requesting support.<\/li>\n<li>During phone calls with a sales representative.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User\u2019s Activity on a Third-Party Site<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a lead uses a third-party website that has integrated SharpSpring forms or tracking code, the information submitted on these forms, and the pages visited on these websites, will be recorded by our Platform.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media<\/span><br \/>\nWhen a social media account is connected to a user\u2019s account on our Platform, we ask the user\u2019s permission to access certain information about the user\u2019s social media account, activities and friends. Social media sites make information available to all apps through their APIs, such as friend lists. The information we receive depends on what information the user or the social media site decides to share with us.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Sources<\/span><br \/>\nSome information is obtained from public records and publicly available databases.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Third Parties<\/span><br \/>\nSome information is provided by joint marketing partners and third-party providers who have confirmed that they have the right to share such information.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5 class=\"heading\">Cookies, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies.<\/h5>\n<p>Some information is collected through cookies. Cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies are used on our Platform to ensure that it functions properly and to give users a more personalized experience.

If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing conducted based on consent before its withdraw.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right of Access<\/span><br \/>\nYou have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not we collect or process personal data concerning you and, if this is the case, you have the right to request a copy of such personal data in digital format.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right of Rectification<\/span><br \/>\nYou have the right to require that we correct any inaccurate personal data concerning you, and that we complete incomplete personal data.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right of Erasure<\/span><br \/>\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we erase personal data concerning you; for example, if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to Restrict Processing<\/span><br \/>\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of the personal data that we have collected about you; for example, where you believe that the personal data that hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to Data Portability<\/span><br \/>\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, and the right to obtain that we transmit the data to another entity where technically feasible.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to Object to the Processing<\/span><br \/>\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we stop processing your personal data.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to Object to the Processing for Direct Marketing Purposes<\/span><br \/>\nYou have the right to request that we stop sending you marketing communications.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right Not to be Subject to Decisions Based Solely on Automated Processing that Produce Legal Effects<\/span><br \/>\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right no to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing \u2013 including profiling \u2013 that produces legal effects or similarly affects you.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority<\/span><br \/>\nYou have the right to lodge complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that our processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5 class=\"heading\">California Residents: Rights under California Law.<\/h5>\n<p>California requires operators of websites or similar services to make certain disclosures to users who reside in California regarding their rights, specifically:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shine the Light<\/span><br \/>\nUnder California law, a business that has an established business relationship with an individual, and has, within the immediately preceding calendar year, disclosed personal data that is primarily used for personal, family or household purposes to third party for the third party\u2019s direct marketing purposes, must disclose to its California users, upon request, the identity of any such third party, along with the type of personal data disclosed.<\/p>\n<p>You can contact us to as provided in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section. Please note that under California law, businesses are only required to respond to a user\u2019s request once during any calendar year.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do-Not-Track<\/span><br \/>\nSome browsers give individuals the ability to communicate that they wish not to be tracked while browsing on the Internet. California law requires that we disclose to users how we treat do-not-track requests. The Internet industry has not yet agreed on a definition of what &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; means, how compliance with \u201cDo Not Track\u201d would be measured or evaluated, or a common approach to responding to a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; signal. Due to the lack of guidance, we have not yet developed features that would recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals in response to California law.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, there are technical means to prevent some of the tracking, if any.
