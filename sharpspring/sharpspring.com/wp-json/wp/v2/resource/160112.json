Before using SharpSpring, the InJoy team was struggling to manage 3-4 sales engagements at a time, and they were seeing a slow and low conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>InJoy\u2019s sales information was spread out all over the place. They were using manual emails, handwritten notes and reminders, and data stored in employee\u2019s heads \u2013 the most dangerous place. Additionally, the leadership team had no visibility into sales or how many deals were in the pipeline, which prevented the company from accurately forecasting revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Today, InJoy Global has 40+ active engagements in the pipeline, and they\u2019re proactively advancing them through a five-step sales process that\u2019s fully powered by SharpSpring.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >Situation<\/h2><h5 class=\"\" >SharpSpring CRM Scales Business Growth<\/h5><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]InJoy Global was looking to streamline and automate its sales process to scale growth. InJoy\u2019s platform was built through a series of custom-developed projects for a few very large corporate clients. Based on those projects, the team chose to expand their platform and develop a commercially viable solution for organizations of all sizes, not just large enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>With this change, instead of managing a handful of large deals, InJoy needed to substantially expand its pipeline and offer its services to a wider set of customers. They instantly went searching for a CRM solution to help manage their new business model.[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"testimonial features-testimonial text-light  \"><div class=\"testimonial-description\"><p>\u201cI\u2019ve used HubSpot and Salesforce at other companies with large budgets. This was not the reality at InJoy; we\u2019re growing our business from the ground up. We needed an intuitive platform that the whole team could easily learn. We looked at many others, but none were even close to the experience we\u2019ve had with SharpSpring.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"testimonial-image\"><h4>Brady Teter<\/h4><p class=\"subtitle\">Director of Business Development, InJoy Global<\/p><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]InJoy quickly implemented a host of features within SharpSpring CRM with the sales pipeline as their main focus. Before using SharpSpring, InJoy\u2019s old-school, rolodex sales style was solely monitored in Gmail and Google Drive. Sales activities weren\u2019t being measured, and there was no visual pipeline.[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"testimonial features-testimonial text-light  \"><div class=\"testimonial-description\"><p>\u201cImplementing the SharpSpring CRM literally took zero effort. I was able to stand it up and start using it the very first day I logged in.

SharpSpring\u2019s pipeline stages are completely flexible to meet the needs of every business niche. With each new lead they get, the sales team can create a new opportunity in the pipeline. And everything in the pipeline can be adjusted to fit InJoy\u2019s needs, such as the name of each opportunity, the order in which they appear, the probability of closing the deal, and the description of each stage in their sales process.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >Solution<\/h2><h5 class=\"\" >CRM Marketing Accelerated Close Rate and Increases Revenue<\/h5><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]Once InJoy got their pipeline up and running, the team quickly realized that their new CRM strategy could provide some tangible, quick wins. By automating some of their internal processes, such as reminders and follow-up emails, the sales team is now able to simultaneously manage several more customer engagements.<\/p>\n<p>These streamlined efforts also helped to maximize and shorten their sales cycle. InJoy was working a lead for an average of four months before closing a deal.
