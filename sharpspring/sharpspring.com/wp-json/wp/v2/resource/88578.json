The agency develops content customized to fit local market standards and then helps distribute that content and measure the results.<\/p>\n<p>The main challenge clients were facing was that while their regional marketing managers had all the necessary pieces of content for running effective local campaigns, they did not have access to the same marketing automation tools that were being used to run campaigns at the global level. As a result, processes that could otherwise be automated, like implementing workflows and tracking leads, required more time and resources, and it was difficult to measure their effectiveness.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >The SharpSpring Solution<\/h2><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]GetIT Comms knew that its clients \u2013 most of whom were already investing a lot in marketing automation solutions for their global campaigns \u2013 wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay for additional expensive accounts dedicated to running regional campaigns. The agency needed to find a marketing automation platform that worked just as well as the pricier, competing solutions but was also affordable, and it found that SharpSpring met both of those requirements. At approximately a tenth the price of competing solutions, SharpSpring\u2019s affordability made it a relatively easy pitch, and GetIT Comms quickly got several of its biggest clients up and running on the platform.[\/vc_column_text]<div class=\"testimonial features-testimonial text-light  \"><div class=\"testimonial-description\"><p>\u201cWith SharpSpring, we can now offer our clients a marketing automation solution that works \u2013 at just a fragment of a fragment of what they\u2019d spend on another platform.

Before adopting SharpSpring, GetIT Comms was struggling to organize and track the emails, newsletters and other content it was creating for its clients\u2019 regional marketing campaigns, and clients were having trouble getting optimal value out of that content.<\/p>\n<p>SharpSpring provides GetIT Comms with a centralized, easily accessible location to manage and track the content it creates, giving the agency more control over how its clients use that content in their marketing campaigns. Additionally, the software tracks and measures the performance of every single piece of content \u2013 from email newsletters and case studies to blog and social media posts \u2013 giving GetIT Comms a much clearer and more holistic view of how its clients\u2019 marketing dollars are at work.<\/p>\n<p>On the client side, SharpSpring allows regional marketing managers to get more out of their campaigns by giving them the tools to create workflows, manage and segment lists, nurture leads, and much more. GetIT Comms and its clients find SharpSpring to be a highly effective tool for collaboration within and among teams, as it offers unprecedented visibility into lead activity.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >Tracking Leads<\/h2><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]The agency and its clients find SharpSpring\u2019s \u201cLife of the Lead\u201d feature to be particularly valuable, offering insights on how leads are interacting with their brands and ways in which they can tailor their content to be more personalized and relevant.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe \u2018Life of the Lead\u2019 is a really nice representation of lead activity,\u201d said Bhattacharya. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to see your various touch points with a given lead and how he or she is reacting to them.\u201d[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;158596&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_column_text]GetIT Comms also uses SharpSpring\u2019s lead scoring feature to provide its clients with a complete picture of all lead interactions, both online and offline. For example, if one of its clients hosts a breakfast seminar, GetIT Comms can create a binary custom variable to represent whether a lead attended or not, as well as attribute a particular numeric score to that variable. As soon as the attendee list is uploaded into the client\u2019s database in SharpSpring, the lead scores of all list members automatically increase to reflect their attendance. This provides the client with a truly comprehensive view of how engaged its leads are.[\/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >A Client Success Story<\/h2><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]GetIT Comms has implemented SharpSpring for a number of its clients, all of whom saw positive results. One such success story is that of Dimension Data, a leading global Information and Communications Technology provider with a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Beginning in 2014, Dimension Data embarked on an intensive content marketing program where it syndicated different forms of content (eBooks, thought leadership articles, informational videos, etc.) across a wide variety of prospects and audiences.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to helping Dimension Data create the actual content, GetIT Comms used SharpSpring to help the company measure content performance and track the lead lifecycle. Armed with powerful new data and insights, Dimension Data was able to segment its prospects into even more specific categories based on their interests and behaviors. GetIT Comms then worked with the company to develop dynamic content tailored to each of those categories, and it set up workflows to automatically nurture leads with that pre-written content.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;158597&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;30px&#8221;]<div class=\" text-left\"><div class=\"m-b-30 custom-heading font-size-30px\"  ><h2 >Final Results<\/h2><span class=\"custom-heading-delim\" style=\"width:140px;\"><\/span><\/div><\/div>[vc_column_text]Soon after adopting SharpSpring, GetIT Comms began to see positive results.

However, as soon as we have control of the marketing automation content hub, it becomes infinitely easier to sell that client on the next campaign. As a result, our project-based relationships essentially become just as stable as<br \/>\nretainer-based work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, just as it became easier for GetIT Comms to sell an existing client on the next project, it also became easier to win over new clients. By pulling workflows and performance stats from its most successful campaigns, the agency was able to create case studies and portfolios to show prospective clients what it could do to improve their marketing campaigns.[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1513979441668{margin-top: 5% !important;border-top-width: 1px !important;border-top-color: #f5f5f5 !important;border-top-style: solid !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;158598&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]GetIT Comms provides marketing solutions to businesses in over 19 countries and 29 cities around the world.
