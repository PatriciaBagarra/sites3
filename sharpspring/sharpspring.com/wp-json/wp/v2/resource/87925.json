SharpSpring\u2019s VisitorID feature allowed the agency to see when prospective and current customers returned to the site and what pages they visited. The life-of-the-lead timeline provided a complete history of how the prospect had interacted with the agency \u2013 from emails opened to form completions, and lead scoring helped them identify and prioritize hot leads.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPreviously, we used to use spreadsheets, an address book, and various other online platforms for managing customer information,&#8221; said Harvey. &#8220;That is now all handled in a single, more structured fashion within SharpSpring.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Demodia then mapped out learning journeys depicting the different stages that prospective clients go through (see Figure 1) and used those maps to create drip email campaigns and content to stay top-of-mind. The agency used SharpSpring to setup workflows to automatically send relevant information \u2013 such as blog posts and whitepapers \u2013 to leads based on their interests and behaviors.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;158618&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<em class=\"caption\"><strong>Figure 1<\/strong>: Demodia uses this learning journey map to depict the different stages that a lead goes through and the nurturing tactics it uses along the way.

Demodia has been able use SharpSpring to introduce marketing automation to its clients and roll it into its paid services.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSharpSpring is the perfect platform for clients to just jump right in, get started quickly, and see results,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe can add on clients easily and choose whether to charge based on the type of engagement we have with a client. SharpSpring\u2019s approach and price point for agencies, and their clients, removes the barriers to entry often associated with marketing automation providers like HubSpot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The agency launches an onboarding email campaign when a client starts using SharpSpring. This series of emails introduces the basic features and how to use them. Over time, the client is carefully walked through a variety more advanced ways it can use marketing automation to achieve its goals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis approach builds client confidence in marketing automation and demonstrates an example of how the client can use it to keep customers engaged,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cIt allows us to automatically deliver content and execute campaigns that wouldn\u2019t be possible through manual efforts. And it makes it easy for us to show the value we can provide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To help clients adopt and realize the benefits of marketing automation more quickly, Demodia immediately adds website tracking to the client\u2019s website to give them visibility into how site visitors are interacting with their brand. Also, the agency has created mapped-out workflows for a variety of nurturing campaigns that clients can implement immediately. For example, if a software client offers free product trials to its customers, Demodia offers a preset email drip campaign in SharpSpring to help the client achieve maximum engagement with trial users (see Figure 2).[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;158619&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]<em class=\"caption\"><strong>Figure 2<\/strong>: Demodia set up a sample automated lead nurturing workflow within SharpSpring to use with clients who offer free trials.
