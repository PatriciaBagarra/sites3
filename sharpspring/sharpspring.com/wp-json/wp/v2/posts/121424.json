Gone are the days when marketers could blast out emails to randomly purchased bulk lists, just hoping something would stick. Spam and undesirable commercial email have become a large enough issue that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Google and Yahoo have been implementing new rules to crack down on the problem.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>*Note: \u2018Spam\u2019 has officially become a marketing automation <strong>curse word<\/strong>, so please excuse my language throughout this article.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>These changes are geared at making the inbox a secure place where people aren\u2019t being constantly bombarded with things they don\u2019t want. Furthermore, they ensure that poor-quality senders are held personally accountable.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s the ISPs \u2013 not marketing automation platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/competitor-comparisons\/hubspot-vs-sharpspring\/\">SharpSpring or HubSpot<\/a>, or Email Service Providers (ESPs) like Gmail or Outlook \u2013 that ultimately dictate which messages will be delivered to the inbox.<\/p>\n<p>So what does all of this mean for your business?<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s All About Reputation<\/h2>\n<p>When evaluating emails for deliverability, ISPs are no longer focused solely on the sender\u2019s IP address. Instead, ISPs now track your individual domain (i.e., \u201cyourcompany.com\u201d), and they use key performance metrics \u2013 hard bounces, soft bounces, engagement rates, spam complaints, and more \u2013 from your past email sends to determine whether your next email will land in the inbox or the junk box. Any bulk send from an email address tied to your company\u2019s domain can affect your domain reputation.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing to remember when it comes to your domain status is that <em><strong>your reputation is yours<\/strong><\/em>. While companies like SharpSpring are eager to help marketers succeed with email marketing, we can only do so much. If you don\u2019t follow the new rules of the road and continue to spam people (intentionally or not), you\u2019ll just keep doing more damage to your domain reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Think of your domain status like credit \u2013 no matter where you go, your credit score follows you. Domain reputation works the same way. Even if you switch marketing automation platforms or hop from one ESP to another, they will eventually figure out that you aren\u2019t following deliverability best practices, and you will be blocked. The ISPs <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">demand<\/span> it.<\/p>\n<p>Now keep in mind, while these changes might seem like an attack on email marketing, <strong>email is still far and away the most cost-effective method to reach customers and prospects<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you avoid spamming your contacts and ensure your emails make it into the prized inbox? Cue the drum roll please\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Put a Ring On It<\/h2>\n<p>The answer is <strong>engagement<\/strong>. That\u2019s right. Email engagement is now one of the most critical metrics for email marketing. Engagement is measured by factors\u00a0such as open rates, click-through rates and visits to your website. Basically, after you propose to a lead, you need to keep that lead interested in you until they\u2019re all the way down the aisle, standing at the altar, and the deal is done.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems is that <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/blog\/nobody-spam-anymore-unsubscribe\/\">nobody complains about spam anymore\u2026 or even bothers to unsubscribe<\/a>. If you keep sending to people who don\u2019t want your emails, and if they\u2019re not unsubscribing or flagging it as spam, you\u2019ll just be doing damage to your domain \u2013 and it <em>will<\/em> catch up with you. Eventually, the ISPs will start filtering your emails into junk and promotional folders, so your recipients \u2013 including the ones who do want your content \u2013 won\u2019t see your messages at all.<\/p>\n<p>Now, ISPs are insisting that you strip out the non-interested people and send only to highly engaged contacts. While this may sound painful, it is vital for preserving your domain reputation, and it will allow you to communicate with the right leads for your business. It will also allow you to give your boss (or your clients) the stats they want to see \u2013 more clicks and higher open rates.<\/p>\n<h2>We\u2019re Here to Be Your Wingman<\/h2>\n<p>According to Forrester, <a href=\"http:\/\/go.sendgrid.com\/rs\/467-KXI-123\/images\/Elevate%20Your%20Email%20Marketing%20With%20A%20Customized%20Approach%20FINAL%20%281%29.pdf\">82% of businesses use email to deliver their marketing messages<\/a>, making it the <em><strong>most popular<\/strong><\/em> option in marketers\u2019 toolboxes. However, only 37% of marketers said they are integrating personalized content with their marketing automation strategy. It\u2019s the most highly used tool, but many businesses aren\u2019t leveraging it to its full potential.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why SharpSpring is creating new functionality to help marketers easily see who is engaging with them and who isn\u2019t. Better yet, SharpSpring will soon allow you to automatically filter out unengaged leads when you\u2019re sending an email. This way, there\u2019s no need to spend hours combing through old spreadsheets or thinning out your contact lists manually. Unengaged leads will be automatically suppressed from future sends until they decide to re-engage with you.<\/p>\n<p>According to industry best practices, an unengaged contact is someone who has received <strong>12 emails<\/strong> from you but has not clicked or opened any of those emails. It\u2019s like a countdown from 12 to zero, and once a lead gets to zero, you\u2019re officially on a break and the engagement is off.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t fret! Unengagement is not a permanent status \u2013 you can still win them back. If at any time your contacts come back to <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/features\/visitorid\/\">visit your website<\/a>, their engagement scores in SharpSpring will jump back up to three, putting them back on your list so you can communicate with them again. You can also send a re-engagement email once a year with targeted content to entice leads to engage with you again. That\u2019s right \u2013 the embarrassing second proposal. But hey, they could say yes at the click of a button.<\/p>\n<p>So the best way to avoid spamming is simply by keeping people engaged, and there are several key strategies that can help you do this.<\/p>\n<h2>Smooth Talk Them With Content<\/h2>\n<p>Sending targeted, <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/blog\/pbj-content-marketing\/\">quality content is the first step<\/a>. Highly engaging emails and witty subject lines are important tactics to get contacts to interact with you. Make sure to segment your lists for increased targeting. When you\u2019re sending an email, take a step back and think about what you\u2019re really trying to say and who you\u2019re trying to say it to. Is it something you need to send to <em>all<\/em> of your contacts?<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, marketing automation provides you with innovative features to ease this process. You can send a single email to a large list, but use dynamic content to customize the message to individual contacts based on <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/blog\/create-buyer-personas-11-tools\/\">buyer personas<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Take it a step further and <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/features\/landingpagebuilder\/#dlp\">create a dynamic landing page<\/a> to expand upon your email. When contacts click on an email, point them to more personalized content to keep them coming back. <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/resources\/email-lists-that-capture-and-convert\/\">In a recent Ascend2 survey<\/a>, marketing agencies said that creating email-specific landing pages is the <em><strong>most effective<\/strong><\/em> strategy in keeping their lists top-notch.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, use caution when emailing marginally engaged contacts. If they haven\u2019t interacted with you over the past few emails, it might be time to switch up your strategy. What\u2019s the point of sending people repeated emails if they\u2019re never even reading them? You want your brand (and your clients\u2019 brands) to be at the forefront of the target market\u2019s mind. An unopened email isn\u2019t doing anyone any good.<\/p>\n<h2>Let Unrequited Love Go<\/h2>\n<p>By following these guidelines, you will achieve <em><strong>more<\/strong><\/em> engagement by sending <em><strong>less<\/strong><\/em> email. It\u2019s a proven fact: click and open rates increase when you&#8217;re sending to a smaller, targeted list of engaged recipients, rather than a large number of unengaged recipients. Who wants to stay in an unrequited romance anyway? Plus, you just never know when those unengaged leads might come crawling back.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019re living in a new email world.
