To show you, we&#8217;ve compiled the delivery, open, and click data for over 5,000 companies that have sent email through SharpSpring since September 2016.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Image-2017-12-01-at-4.38.46-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28392\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Image-2017-12-01-at-4.38.46-PM.png\" alt=\"Comparison Chart\" width=\"851\" height=\"437\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n3\u00a0things should jump out at you pretty quickly:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>These 5,000 companies are sending 30 million (50%) fewer emails since the same time last year.<\/li>\n<li>The raw number of opens are the same as last year<\/li>\n<li>The raw number of clicks is 5% higher than it was at the same time last year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To drill into the data, we\u2019ve focused on the time before and after we released our email engagement tools and normalized the sending data per 1,000 deliveries, which results in this chart:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/V3_30_million_Less_Emails_Sent_1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28388\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/V3_30_million_Less_Emails_Sent_1.png\" alt=\"email engagement tool\" width=\"856\" height=\"568\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here we see a substantial reduction in emails being sent (-33%), <em>but opens and clicks both increased<\/em>. With such a reduction in email send volume, you might expect to see a similar reduction in opens and clicks, but this is clearly not the case. In fact, we are seeing a 12% increase in\u00a0opens and a 6% increase in clicks.<\/p>\n<p>How could this be?<\/p>\n<p>First, it\u2019s important to remember that the only recipients to whom emails are being suppressed are people who were not opening or clicking on the emails anyway. With this in mind, it should not be surprising that we don\u2019t see a decrease in opens or clicks from this group of unengaged recipients.<\/p>\n<p>Second, and even more important, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Yahoo have shifted focus toward engagement, and they reward reputable senders (ones who prioritize sending to engaged recipients) by putting more of their emails in the inbox rather than in the spam folder.<\/p>\n<p>As every marketer knows, better inboxing means more recipients are seeing your message, which leads to more opens and clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, we have seen a corresponding increase in the open and click percentages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/V3_30_million_Less_Emails_Sent_1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28389\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/V3_30_million_Less_Emails_Sent_1.png\" alt=\"Engagement Tool Impact comparison\" width=\"808\" height=\"522\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, these 5,000 companies benefited greatly by reducing email sends to unengaged recipients. Open and click rates both shot up, and raw\/total opens and clicks went up too.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll say it again and again \u2013 the world of <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/email-marketing\/\">email marketing<\/a> has changed. After years of focusing on hard\/soft bounces and spam complaints, ISPs have shifted the focus toward <strong>engagement<\/strong>. This ensures that senders are held personally accountable (read more about this below) and that they\u2019re only communicating with people who <em>want<\/em> to receive their content.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Domain Reputation Follows You<\/h2>\n<p>By preventing sends to unengaged recipients, SharpSpring is helping to protect your domain reputation and ensure engaged recipients continue receiving your content. As we&#8217;ve pointed out, ISPs are growing increasingly sophisticated in their battle\u00a0against spam and unwanted email. In addition to tracking engagement, ISPs are now tracking <strong><em>your<\/em><\/strong> sending domain.<\/p>\n<p>This is another fundamental shift in the way ISPs are targeting specific email senders. Not long ago, ISPs only tracked the IP address of the sender and blocked the offending IP to prevent spam messages from being sent. This enabled malicious senders to jump from email provider to email provider in order to avoid detection, while continuing to get their messages delivered.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the rules have changed. ISPs are tracking the specific sending domain of the sender and flagging that domain, regardless of which email service provider the sender uses to send mail. A sender using poor sending practices can create long-term damage to their sending reputation that they\u00a0won&#8217;t be able to escape from. This is yet another reason\u00a0why senders must pay attention to engagement and best practices in order to be successful in today\u2019s email environment.<\/p>\n<h4>Want more info about managing email engagement?<\/h4>\n<p>Today, email is largely viewed in web browsers, where ISPs can see how people are interacting in ways they couldn\u2019t see just a few short years ago when most email was viewed via offline email clients like Outlook or Apple Mail. ISPs are using these new insights to see whether the emails that are being sent by businesses are actually wanted by the people who are receiving them. They do this by measuring open and click rates, and by monitoring if the emails are being forwarded, shared, or saved in folders. All of these actions mean the recipient finds the email \u201cengaging\u201d and valuable.<\/p>\n<p>People have gotten tired of receiving irrelevant or spammy emails, so ISPs have responded by changing the rules of the sending game. And SharpSpring has grown to meet this focus on engagement to ensure you are getting the best possible delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115000367292-Email-Engagement-Tools\">email engagement tools<\/a> allow you to easily segment your recipients into three categories: Engaged, Almost Unengaged, and Unengaged. These tools give you the opportunity to customize your messaging based on how engaged your leads are, so you can boost the chances that they\u2019ll open your emails.<\/p>\n<p>The tools also automatically identify contacts that are not engaging with your emails at all, to help ensure you\u2019re not damaging your domain reputation by sending to people that don&#8217;t want to receive content from you.<\/p>\n<h2>Here\u2019s a summary of how\u00a0the tools\u00a0work:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>If a contact doesn\u2019t open or click on a certain number of emails (up to 16 emails if they have filled out a form), then they are considered unengaged and you will be unable to send to them.<\/li>\n<li>If a contact is at risk for becoming unengaged, our tools help you identify those contacts so you can send them more targeted messaging to encourage them to re-engage.<\/li>\n<li>Any interaction that indicates interest (an open, click, or form-fill) automatically resets the recipient to \u201cfully engaged\u201d (a score of 16), and a marketer can have 16 new interactions with that recipient before they are considered unengaged again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In short, if you\u2019ve not already hopped on the bandwagon of this new email delivery paradigm, it\u2019s time that you did.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Want to learn more?
