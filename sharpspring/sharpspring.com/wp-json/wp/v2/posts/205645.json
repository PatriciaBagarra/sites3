According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/dma.org.uk\/uploads\/misc\/marketers-email-tracker-2019.pdf\">Marketing Email Tracker<\/a> from Data and Marketing Association, for every $1 you spend on email marketing, you can expect an average return of $42. But to see your emails increase your customer base and improve brand awareness, you have to effectively build your email lists. When it comes to increasing the number of contacts, it can seem instantly gratifying to grow it quickly when you buy an email list.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Resist this impulse, as it\u2019s one of the classic email marketing mistakes to avoid!<\/strong><\/em> (&#8230;and <a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115001068468-Understanding-Purchased-Email-Recipient-Lists-and-Email-Verification-Services\">against SharpSpring&#8217;s policies<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>So, what tactics <em>can<\/em> you use to build your email lists quickly without making a potentially sketchy purchase?<\/p>\n<p>This post highlights four key strategies to help you avoid having to buy an email list.<\/p>\n<h2>Strategies to Avoid Buying An Email List<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Add a Subscribe Form to Your Blog<\/h3>\n<p>Your blog is one of the most useful \u2014 and easiest \u2014 ways to build your contact list. We suggest <a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-triggered-emails\/\">including a form and an in-text link<\/a> in your actual blog content, inviting people to sign up for your newsletter.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Run Contests Asking for Emails<\/h3>\n<p>When there is something people can win, they are more likely to give you their information. Ask people to enter with their emails in the application form or in the instructions.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Add Share Buttons to Your Emails<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to adding social share buttons, which you should include in all of your emails, you should also give your contacts a way to forward the email to their friends.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing their email not only shows your lead is moving along in their buyer\u2019s journey, they are also indicating how delighted they are with the content you\u2019re sending them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> When writing out content to include in the social sharing link, customize it and make sure to edit the metadata, as this is what will show on Facebook and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Public Speaking, Conferences and Trade Shows<\/h3>\n<p>Useful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesartillery.com\/blog\/purchased-email-lists-unprotected-sex\">offline strategies<\/a> to avoid having to buy an email list include making contacts at public speaking events, conferences and trade shows.<\/p>\n<p>When people meet you in person and learn about exactly what your business does, not only are they more likely to give you their emails, they are also more likely to become a customer. At these public gatherings, invite people to sign up for your newsletter to hear more. Just make sure to bring ways for people to give you their contact information \u2014 be it a piece of paper or a QR code.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> if you do opt for a piece of paper, make sure you can actually make out the writing before people leave your booth.<\/p>\n<h2>Email Marketing Best Practices<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you have grown your contact base using the tactics above, what email marketing strategies do you need to employ to guarantee results?<\/p>\n<h3>1. Personalization<\/h3>\n<p>The more personal, the better. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.experianplc.com\/media\/news\/2014\/experian-marketing-services-study-finds-personalized-emails-generate-six\/\">An Experian study<\/a> found that personalized emails deliver 6x higher transaction rates.<\/p>\n<p>Humans love when <a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-take-marketing-personalization-to-the-next-level\/\">content is personalized<\/a> to who we are as people. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to incorporate personalization in your email marketing strategies. It could be as simple as addressing your lead by their first name and using yours to sign off, but some kind of personal touch is proven to benefit email marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Be Visually Appealing<\/h3>\n<p>Once your contacts from the email list open their email, they need to like what they see.<\/p>\n<p>Use white space to your advantage, choose an image that is not too aggressive but engaging enough to entice your contact to feel something. Try to avoid large chunks of text \u2014 as a rule of thumb, use one to two sentences per paragraph.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Be Responsive<\/h3>\n<p>Respond to requests for information efficiently no matter where your contact is viewing the content. According to Adestra, emails that display incorrectly may be deleted within <a href=\"https:\/\/uplandsoftware.com\/adestra\/resources\/blog\/ab-testing-your-email-design-10-tips-not-to-overlook\/\">three seconds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Ensure Your Content is Well Written<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to your email, it needs to be well-written and sound authentic to your brand voice. Make sure you have a clear purpose in your content, as well as a story that takes contacts from start to end and guarantees they\u2019ll be excited for more.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Have a Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to including the share button, you want to ensure the main CTA you intend the lead to take is obvious.<\/p>\n<p>With each email you write, make sure you have one main CTA, whether it\u2019s to watch a video, read a blog post or download an infographic. Whatever the step is, the lead should know exactly what you want them to do.<\/p>\n<p>These are just some of the many email marketing automation best practices to be aware of when setting your strategy.
