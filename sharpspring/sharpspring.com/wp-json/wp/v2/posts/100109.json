To celebrate, we\u2019ve compiled some best practices and testing ideas for you to get started making your emails work harder for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A\/B Testing, also known as split testing, shows two versions of marketing variables and lets your consumers decide which is the \u201cwinner,\u201d based on which version they react better to (more opens, more clicks, etc). These variables can be part of your website design, landing page, display or text ad, lead form, or in this instance, the emails that you are sending.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Providing different versions of your email to statistically significant groups of subscribers allows you to measure the effect each of these versions has on your goals. As a result, when you optimize your email marketing strategy you are working off of actual data, not just a hunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Goals<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first, and probably most important step, is determining your goal for the test. There are many variables that you can change in your email marketing campaign that will impact how effective your emails are. Do you want to get a higher open rate? You can try testing your subject line to improve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here is a list of some common goals to begin testing around:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What is the open rate?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What is the click-through rate?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What is the on-site conversion rate from the email traffic?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What is the bounce rate?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Segmentation<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Once you have determined your goal, it\u2019s time to segment. With SharpSpring, this step is accomplished by creating Dynamic Lists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">There are a few methods for segmenting your lists for the test. No matter which method you choose, the segments need to be randomized in order to ensure the most accurate results. SharpSpring does the randomization within your Dynamic List for you, which allows you to focus on building relevant, well-segmented lists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The first, which is the most simple, is a straightforward 50\/50 split, with one half receiving one version of the email and the other receiving a slightly modified version.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Another option is to do a test on a smaller percentage of your list, and then send out the winning variable to the rest of your list. This is a good method to use if you\u2019re testing something dramatically different from previous emails, or if you are running a limited time offer. Make sure that your initial test is going out to enough subscribers to gain statistical significance, or your results could be skewed or inconclusive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here are a few more tips to get the best segmentation:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Remove inactive users that can drag your results down<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Highly active users should be split evenly between the two variations, or not included in the test. These users are more likely to engage anyway, so separating them out will ensure that too many in one variable won\u2019t skew results.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Testing\u20261, 2, 3\u2026<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now is the time to pick the variable you\u2019d like to test! Below are a few ideas to get you started, but the possibilities are endless when it comes to A\/B testing ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Personalization in headline or body copy? Or a more generic email?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What time of day performs best?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What day of week performs best?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Punctuation \u2013 does a question in the headline work better? Exclamation points?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Length- short and sweet, or long and detailed?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Tone\u2013 Straightforward? Funny? Mysterious?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Offer in the headline? In the copy? (Free v. percentage off, demo v. trial)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Call to Action \u2013 Buy now? Purchase Now? Add to Cart? Play around with various calls to action depending on your end goal.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Change the location of the call to action button throughout the email (top v. bottom, left v. right)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Change the color or shape of the call to action button<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Image heavy email, purely text or a mix?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What kind of images you show- Stock images? Products? Employees? Cute animals?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Who the email is from- is it more impactful from the CEO? Marketing Ddirector? Sales person?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Utilize your Dynamic Lists that you\u2019ve created in the SharpSpring interface to take your testing a step further, and test specific variables with different segments.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These are just a few of the many ideas that you can start testing with, and a great first step in making your email marketing work more efficiently for you. Just remember to only test one of these at a time, or you won\u2019t be able to differentiate which change is affecting your metrics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now that you\u2019ve got some great ideas on what A\/B testing is and how to make it work for you, get started!
