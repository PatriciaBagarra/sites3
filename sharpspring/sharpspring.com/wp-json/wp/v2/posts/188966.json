SharpSpring&#8217;s Meetings allows teams to easily book appointments without unnecessary back-and-forth communication.<\/p>\n<p>Eliminate scheduling friction with leads and prospects so you can optimize the time your team spends selling, ultimately improving sales conversions and boosting revenue. The Meetings tool empowers your team members to publish their availability so prospects can self-schedule appointments any time\u2014hassle-free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Everything you need, all in one place<\/strong><br \/>\nMeetings comes fully integrated with SharpSpring\u2019s full suite of marketing and sales tools. You can take full advantage of powerful interactions with all your favorite marketing automation features\u2014like the <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/features\/automation\/\">Visual Workflow builder<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360021944891-Activity-Feed-Overview\">Activity Feed<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360024982291-Task-Manager-Overview\">Task Manager<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115001066968-Sending-Smart-Mail?sslid=MzW0tDAztLQ0MDEwAgA&amp;sseid=MzQ3tLA0MjC0NAEA&amp;jobid=94c10b8f-9e1b-4c81-bcda-69041cf00cbb#h_343844874101530191181603\">SmartMail<\/a>. Add in the power of <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/resources\/sales-optimizer\/\">Sales Optimizer<\/a> and you\u2019ll have everything you need to quickly scale the cadence and quality of your engagement with prospects!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amplify the impact of every sales meeting <\/strong><br \/>\nGo beyond the capabilities of a standalone calendar tool. Meetings allows you to trigger high-impact marketing and sales automation with a booked meeting. When a lead schedules a consultation, demo, or call, SharpSpring instantly assigns a sales rep to host the meeting and triggers a notification to that host with the meeting date and type. You can also create a new opportunity from a booked meeting, boost lead scores or trigger a follow-up email once a meeting is complete, so a lead never gets forgotten again.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say a lead self-schedules a consultation for Monday morning on Sunday. SharpSpring can automatically send a confirmation email, notify your team, and create a new opportunity so they\u2019ll be set up for success\u2014even when they\u2019re not in the office.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reduce no shows and boost conversions<\/strong><br \/>\nEver had a meeting scheduled with a lead who doesn\u2019t show up? Sure, they may have ghosted you, but there\u2019s a good chance they just forgot. Meetings automatically sends out confirmation and reminder emails to help reduce no shows, and our seamless integration with Zoom adds the meeting link right to the lead and host calendar invites so you never miss a beat with your leads again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay up-to-date on team availability <\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s never been easier to manage a busy sales team with SharpSpring. Scheduled events appear on personal calendars for review and modification. Admins can manage Meetings settings and white-label meeting links to provide an immersive experience for leads. Salespeople can see meeting events in their Task Manager, Activity Feed and Life of the Lead so they can stay on top of daily meetings and view past interactions. All this visibility makes it easier than ever to streamline your sales management process with a birds-eye view of your team\u2019s availability and upcoming meetings for the week.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no need to waste time or energy on assigning leads with Meetings. When a new lead books a meeting looking for more information about you, SharpSpring\u2019s solution can automatically assign the next available sales rep to host that meeting.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-188971\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/Meetings_Feature_Product_20.gif\" alt=\"SharpSpring's Meetings tool in action\" width=\"708\" height=\"620\" \/><strong>Sync with Google Calendar and Outlook, we\u2019ll handle the rest<\/strong><br \/>\nGetting started is simple.
