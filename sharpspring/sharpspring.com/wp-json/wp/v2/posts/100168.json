It\u2019s also a good idea to send an email with the recipient\u2019s name included in the email,.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><b>Email Blasting<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It\u2019s impractical for a marketing department to send a separate email to every single potential lead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, the age-old method of email blasting is not the best way to reach every single recipient. The best way to reach a group of people, but still make it personally significant is through <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.business2community.com\/email-marketing\/email-marketing-automation-behavior-based-segmentation-0774131#!ykeds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">behavior based segmentation<\/a>. Start by dividing the groups of people who access your website into separate groups.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">These groups can include the following types of customers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Customers who buy from you frequently<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Visitors who access the website, but don\u2019t finish the buying process<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Customers who don\u2019t respond to emails or click on calls to action<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">All three of these groups can be placed in their own segment and receive separate emails by group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For the group that buys frequently, you can provide a thank you message as well as a quick survey to see what they like about the product or service you are providing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For the visitors who search, but don\u2019t buy, you can include a free trial through email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For those customers that don\u2019t answer emails, you can then assign them to a lead nurturing campaign. That way you can check in with these customers sporadically, while focusing on the leads who are more interested in your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The best way to design an effective email marketing campaign is to truly understand your buyer\u2019s persona. This will allow you to send a small number of emails, while reaching a large number of people that connects with the email recipients on a personal level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A better understanding of your client base will allow you to design effective email marketing campaigns.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Email marketing campaigns are a great way to generate leads, but there are two common problems that need to be worked through when devising email marketing campaigns The spam folder and the ancient art of email blasting are two problems that all email marketing campaigns encounter.
