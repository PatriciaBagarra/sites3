But if you really want to grow your business, email marketing is the real MVP. According to Mckinsey, email marketing is\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/business-functions\/marketing-and-sales\/our-insights\/why-marketers-should-keep-sending-you-emails\">40 times more effective at acquiring new customers<\/a>\u00a0than Facebook or Twitter \u2013 but only if you do it correctly.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re considering <a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/email-marketing\/\">email marketing<\/a> for the first time or looking for ways to upgrade your current strategy, there are a few things you should know. Crafting the perfect email isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. There\u2019s a whole strategy behind email marketing \u2013 knowing what works and what doesn\u2019t, what to do and what not to do.<\/p>\n<p>Before hitting send, check out this list of email marketing do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to help make sure you don\u2019t end up in the spam box.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Develop an Email Marketing Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Before you start writing your email ask yourself a few questions: Why are you sending out this email? Who are you sending it to? How often will you send out emails? Do you have a set day and time your email will go out each week? What are your goals for this email?<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t answer these questions, you shouldn\u2019t be sending out any emails.<\/p>\n<p>Developing a strategy and plan is the first step to success. Once complete, this will be your business\u2019s roadmap to email marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Divide and Conquer<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.revitalagency.com\/blog\/10-easy-ways-quickly-build-email-list\/\">solid list of email subscribers built<\/a>, you need to begin email marketing segmentation. Segmented email campaigns have a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.webpresencesolutions.net\/email-marketing-statistics-2017\/\">14% higher open rate<\/a>\u00a0than non-segmented campaigns. Developing lists based on demographic data can tell you a lot about your leads and how to nurture them. You can then use the information about prospects\u2019 interests, concerns and needs to nurture them through the buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n<p>You should always know who your target audience is, and you should always be sure you have permission to email your prospects and customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Be a Headline Hero<\/h2>\n<p>More than 30% of email recipients decide whether or not to open a email based on the subject alone, so here are some tips to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u25cf Make it click-worthy. Don\u2019t be boring.<br \/>\n\u25cf Keep it short.<br \/>\n\u25cf Don\u2019t use all caps. You\u2019re not yelling at your subscribers.<br \/>\n\u25cf Make readers curious. E.g., \u201cAre you making these social media mistakes?\u201d<br \/>\n\u25cf Entice with an incentive or an offer.<br \/>\n\u25cf Use a sense of urgency, without using the word \u201cURGENT.\u201d<br \/>\n\u25cf Tell them what\u2019s inside. \u201cYour free ebook is inside.\u201d or \u201cYour exclusive offer awaits.\u201d<br \/>\n\u25cf Use numbers. \u201c5 social media hacks that work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Think about what makes you want to open an email or news article. Be creative and have some fun with it.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Make it Personal<\/h2>\n<p>Subscribers are\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.webpresencesolutions.net\/email-marketing-statistics-2017\/\">18% more likely to open personalized emails<\/a>\u00a0compared to emails without any personalization. Use their first name in the introduction, make it personal in the body of the copy \u2013 mention their industry or location.<\/p>\n<p>This is where marketing automation features like dynamic content play in, which let you use one email to appeal to the individual needs of a variety of recipients. You can take that personalization a step further by having the email link to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/blog\/make-personalized-marketing-effortless-with-dynamic-landing-pages\/\">dynamic landing page<\/a>\u00a0with more information that caters to the user\u2019s interests.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Include These Email Must-Haves<\/h2>\n<p>First and foremost, have a template. Use that template as the foundation for all of your emails. Make sure your template includes the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\u25cf Your brand\u2019s logo<br \/>\n\u25cf A headline<br \/>\n\u25cf A call to action (CTA)<br \/>\n\u25cf Social media buttons<br \/>\n\u25cf An unsubscribe button<br \/>\n\u25cf Links, links, links! (Links to reference articles, links to your website, etc.)<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Be Mindful With Your Copy<\/h2>\n<p>The body of your email should feature copy and content that add value to the reader\u2019s life. Whether you\u2019re providing useful tips, highlighting a giveaway, or breaking down important industry news, you need to know what you want to say before you start writing your email.<\/p>\n<p>Outline the types of content you want to share with your subscribers: company blog posts, upcoming events, general news, featured photos, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be too wordy in your copy. This isn\u2019t your diary. Make it short and to-the-point. You don\u2019t want to give away all the goodies in your email. You want to intrigue subscribers so they\u2019ll keep reading, so add a link or CTA for them to get to the full-length version.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Use Creative Content<\/h2>\n<p>Always remember, content is king. Whether your email is promoting a new product or sharing industry information, content is the heart of your email.<\/p>\n<p>Make your email stand out with bold fonts, colors, segments, infographics, special headline fonts, and images. Subscribers are more likely to engage with your email if something stands out to them.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Proofread and Test<\/h2>\n<p>Before hitting send, don\u2019t forget to test your email. Not only is this vital to make sure all your links work, but with most subscribers checking emails on their smart devices, it\u2019s more important than ever to know what your email will look like to readers on both mobile and desktop.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Remember That \u201cTiming Is Everything\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a right and wrong time to send out emails. Use analytics to determine what works best for your subscribers. You might need to to try sending out emails at different times and and on different days to see what works.<\/p>\n<p>Set a schedule. Decide if your email campaign will be sent out on a daily, weekly, or biweekly basis. Be careful not to overdo it. Your customers want to hear from you, but they don\u2019t want their inbox constantly bombarded. There\u2019s no cheat-sheet on how often you should email your customers, but one thing\u2019s for sure \u2013 if you send too often, your users will unsubscribe faster than you can hit \u201csend\u201d on that next email.<\/p>\n<h2>Thou Shalt Invest in Marketing Automation Software<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have a solid email marketing strategy, you will need to invest in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.revitalagency.com\/blog\/11-best-marketing-automation-tools-need\/\">marketing automation software<\/a>. Marketing automation allows you to create personalized, automated emails \u2013 for example, a \u201cthank you\u201d email that triggers when a new subscriber signs up for your newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>Marketing automation software also lets you see how readers interact with your content \u2013 through click rates, open rates and more \u2013 ultimately letting you know what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>Follow These Rules\u2026 And You Shall Succeed<\/h2>\n<p>Achieving success with your email marketing campaigns isn\u2019t an impossible feat, as long as you put in the work and make sure you\u2019re always using best practices. Develop a clear strategy, keep your lists clean, create an attractive template that represents your brand, stick to a solid sending schedule, and don\u2019t forget to test, test, test. Then\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/sharpspring.com\/get-a-demo\/\">add marketing automation into the mix<\/a>\u00a0to make it all more manageable \u2013 and you can expect to start seeing stellar results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the age of technology, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the mix of digital media channels and social media platforms.
