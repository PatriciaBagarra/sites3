It builds credibility, helps to brand your company and gets your name out to a ready audience who are keen to purchase your products. However, the ability to measure results is at the center of every successful email campaign, and this is where email automation tools become so valuable.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Benefits of Email Automation Tools<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll discuss the advantages in more detail later, but below are some of the main benefits you&#8217;ll gain from email automation tools:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email automation tools enable you to send, test and maximize your market results. They also make it easier to maintain your lists and allow you to spot and address deliverability issues.<\/li>\n<li>Email automation tools can help you keep you in compliance with CAN-SPAM laws too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you place a lead into a drip series, you can let go of the wheel and watch as they are nudged further down the pipeline, until you get the result you&#8217;re looking for: a conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you understand the benefits of email automation, let&#8217;s look at five ways they can maximize your campaign results.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">#1 Segment Your Email Lists<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25047\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/1URWgqUZ-DLxN_3sAPi5EJqtW3DecxtSpxqU3stt7mvcgqIQfAKS1M4oG90lc01w9t0XaWLi46nJEeEs5sXaz8k2ZaTxfy2-QJt-WKJF8oEgyhQ9JxsQ-naibxZiwR2xhEueZEmJ.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"487\" \/>The first and most crucial step to <a href=\"\/email-marketing\/\">email marketing automation<\/a> is segmentation. Only when customer lists are sorted by demographic and behavioral factors can drip emails become truly personalized and effective. Categorize your customer lists based on demographic data, information gleaned from social media sites, behavioral data, and more. With this more complete picture, your messaging will be hyper-relevant to recipients, and your open rates, conversions, and overall brand experience will improve.<\/p>\n<p>The statistics regarding the effectiveness of email segmentation speak for themselves. The Direct Marketing Association says <a href=\"https:\/\/dma.org.uk\/uploads\/ckeditor\/National-client-email-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketers who use segmentation see a 760% increase in revenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">#2 Personalize Your Messages with Email Automation Tools<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getvero.com\/resources\/the-retention-email\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25048\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/50-DEEJDbazbedkGypezY_o7PFSFFVg1H7s4me4xSfPLgg_ZgpubSnNNCljKDvPSZ_npGff3b2XPeswzSEmoJgD2vfTWPcVAvdyr4pHNkkkduSMNG8VwsRQnXBVWlZ95xQ2s79yZ.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"753\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Marketers shouldn&#8217;t underestimate the power of personalization.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers expect brands to treat them as unique individuals, especially in the personal space of their inboxes.<\/p>\n<p>Personalized email receives<a href=\"https:\/\/www.experianplc.com\/media\/news\/2014\/experian-marketing-services-study-finds-personalized-emails-generate-six\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u00a029% higher open rates and 41% higher click-through rates<\/a>. Simply including your customer&#8217;s name in the email subject line is known to boost engagement by 22%.<\/p>\n<p>Speak to prospects with familiarity to maximize their engagement rates with your email. Include specific information like company name or purchase history to build trust and familiarity.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/features\/#Email\">Contextual behavioral messaging makes emails feel authentic<\/a> instead of robotic.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see in the image above, Airbnb knows how to prompt a purchase after cart abandonment.<\/p>\n<p>The travel brand delivers an email reminder that calls the recipient by name, references the item under consideration, and includes pictures to spike interest. This level of specificity creates a conversational feel that consumers love and are eager to engage with.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">#3 Choose Between Dynamic or Basic Emails<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25052\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/pYgJslmaJPWE188AqsAFVUM9WB_2WoR5CCiMfqeSH2BjSo4IgA1G-MLgUAlAeV3sVgY-2O6j18hzTiJtes0cDRE2mtO0WGm6Ve46HhDA6yL0yUkWwCq1LG6OjVP5KyoMBvNCPSIj.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"390\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Email layout and design impacts conversion rates.<\/p>\n<p>So, should you make your messaging aesthetically alluring to tempt a conversion? Linear to streamline click-through rates?<\/p>\n<p>It depends on your objective and who you&#8217;re targeting.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the real question you should be asking is this: what will your customer want to see based on their position in the funnel?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/features\/email\/\">Dynamic email<\/a> helps you personalize your messaging based on where leads are in the funnel, so you can improve open rates and boost retention. Physical products benefit from a visual email layout, as do rich media types and promotions.<\/p>\n<p>In the image above, we see online classroom Skillshare appeal to a visually-oriented customer base with a beautifully designed email. This format is effective for artistic types, offering a free month trial that benefits from a beautiful backdrop to encourage sign ups.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25049\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Ii71jR3VzHt8A4CANGdP6iLKx3RXwzxQ0uSs78IrEwT0LMjM6eihvv2tbMrahj_Op5Urve6cd6up3YXbsTix0litc5IjSHJer7ahAuWrZwX0Q4WFhu7nJbY9l_zUfWou0YDfv19y.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"998\" height=\"444\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a simple email from marketing guru Neil Patel. Since Neil\u2019s trying to drive traffic, increase his thought leadership, and position his products, he correctly opts for a minimal and informative layout.<\/p>\n<p>Neil understands his readers. They open emails to learn and to get quick solutions. Elaborate design or content would just be distracting. A direct statement of benefits and an unmistakable CTA nets the highest CTR and conversion rates.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">#4 Optimally Place Your Calls to Action<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25050\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/M2szB65uI6a_szhcEtOtqU3seto5RMeAGnsyugC2l36VS5DpR1Qt0F08T3O3i8Gg-387bIqY-LZ9TZos7xcAufuxHWKGMbb4O2jVZYvWhzhHz8kpRxjWimDNTGfvtNpgEubQWTk9-768x747.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"584\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An effective call to action should be obvious and should actively encourage clicks.<\/p>\n<p>Your readers will not scour your email copy for a CTA in order to take the next step. It&#8217;s up to you to make it easy for them to convert.<\/p>\n<p>Place CTAs where they\u2019re easily seen and make sense.<\/p>\n<p>Positioning the CTA at the bottom of your email is the norm, since conversions usually happen after you\u2019ve promised value.<\/p>\n<p>Some CTAs may work better at the top, however, as seen in the previous example from Skillshare. Split-test different designs to find what suits your offering and customer base.<\/p>\n<p>Just as importantly, always use actionable language to drive results with your CTA.<\/p>\n<p>The Brightcove email above promotes a webinar, calling readers to \u201cWatch Now.\u201d Active verbs drive conversions because they&#8217;re both descriptive and directly instructional. A bold purple CTA button draws the eye and aligns with the email design, helping it stand out for optimal clicks.<\/p>\n<p>To maximize your email conversions, bring CTAs to the forefront and write compelling copy that makes the benefits of clicking immediately obvious.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">#5 The Benefits of Email Automation Tools in Testing and Optimizing Emails<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/unbounce.com\/email-marketing\/ab-test-welcome-emails\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25051\" src=\"https:\/\/sharpspring.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/p_I8r-uEJlf5ZNWMZGENrjq5cuoeesn-j3zRdDiKMrWsCDbgxjdw5LJjfOnB5p8fEODICinNguZMcE5mHXRkWN9q3Zu8711cKr_Yxh3xgjW4kSmoNrDwOoSYSHFtrexrlj4Cw2G0-768x367.png\" alt=\"automated emails\" width=\"600\" height=\"287\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t measure your email performance, you can\u2019t improve it.<\/p>\n<p>The right email automation tools allows you to measure the results of your email campaigns through KPIs like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivery Rates<\/li>\n<li>View Rates<\/li>\n<li>Open Rates<\/li>\n<li>Click-Through Rates<\/li>\n<li>Sales Conversions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then, you can use your insights from these metrics to optimize conversion rates going forward. Once you have a sense of how your emails are performing in general, A\/B test your email campaigns to improve even further.<\/p>\n<p>Adjust the sending time to reach your lists when they\u2019re most receptive. You should also A\/B test your content for factors like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subject Line<\/li>\n<li>Sender Name<\/li>\n<li>Capitalization<\/li>\n<li>Greeting Personalization<\/li>\n<li>Email Layout and Design<\/li>\n<li>CTA Copy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Send different types of content and offers to find out exactly what your prospects want to engage with. Understanding your audience and optimizing your delivery are the final factors in building a drip email campaign that will get you game-changing results.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Last Drop<\/h2>\n<p>You should now understand the benefits of email automation tools. Like morning coffee before a workday, automation is a key part of effective email marketing.<\/p>\n<p>To optimally engage your audience, first segment your contact lists. From there, use data to personalize the email experience and create conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Utilize email design that suits your industry and audience, being sure to place CTAs effectively for conversions. Optimize your email marketing strategy with analytics, reporting, and A\/B testing to achieve the best metrics and revenues.<\/p>\n<p>By deploying email automation tools, marketers can set, forget and maximize their drip engagement strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, this can result in increased sales, better branding and a better understanding of the campaigns that appeal most to your audience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When used properly, email marketing can be one of the most effective ways to boost your business.
