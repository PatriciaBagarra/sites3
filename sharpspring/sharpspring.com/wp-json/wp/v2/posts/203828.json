In fact, there were approximately 3.9 billion email users in 2019, and that number is projected to grow to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/255080\/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide\/\">4.48 billion by 2024<\/a>. It goes without saying that with numbers like these, companies can\u2019t overlook <a href=\"\/blog\/10-commandments-email-marketing\/\">email marketing<\/a>. One way to spice up your email approach is to kickstart your email drip campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Email Drip Campaigns?<\/h2>\n<p>A drip campaign is a series of automated email messages that are programmed to send when <a href=\"\/blog\/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-triggered-emails\/\">triggered by a specific event<\/a>. An email drip campaign can not only help establish a line of communication with your audience, but it can also nurture leads, boost engagement and improve your conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, you will learn about the top five drip campaign examples and how to implement them into your digital marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Examples of Email Drip Campaigns<\/h2>\n<h3>Example #1 &#8211; Welcome Emails<\/h3>\n<p>Any time a visitor on your website subscribes to your email list or signs up for notifications, you should send out a welcome email message. During a drip campaign, this type of email can automatically send whenever someone new subscribes.<\/p>\n<p>Your welcome email needs to be thoughtful and adhere to your brand standards and convey the appropriate message to hook the recipient. If your welcome email doesn&#8217;t resonate well with your audience, then you will see a higher number of people unsubscribing.<\/p>\n<h3>Example #2 &#8211; Onboarding Emails<\/h3>\n<p>After a visitor subscribes to your emailing list and you send out the welcome message, you can initiate an <a href=\"\/blog\/sharpspring-onboarding-success\/\">onboarding email<\/a> drip campaign. Signing up to receive emails is one thing; getting the lead to sign up for a free trial is another thing entirely. At this step in the drip campaign, you will be able to score your leads and figure out which ones are qualifying.<\/p>\n<p>Onboarding messages tends to highlight the advantages of your products or services. They also need to be smooth and simplistic, as heavy content will not resonate well with your target at this point.<\/p>\n<h3>Example #3 &#8211; Engagement Emails<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve hooked and onboarded some of your leads, it\u2019s time to get them to be more active with your brand. Engagement emails give the recipients a chance to express themselves while also providing you with valuable customer data such as birthdays, interests, pain points and more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/help.sharpspring.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115000367292-Using-Email-Engagement-Tools\">Engagement emails<\/a> can ask for feedback on products, customer service and anything else related to your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Example #4 &#8211; Nurturing Emails<\/h3>\n<p>If the recipients on your emailing list have subscribed to your blog, you can notify them whenever you publish a new article. Not only will this keep your company fresh in their minds, but it will also <a href=\"\/resources\/lead-nurturing\/\">nurture your leads<\/a> and build brand trust.<\/p>\n<h3>Example #5 &#8211; Abandoned Cart Emails<\/h3>\n<p>Of all of the drip campaign examples, the abandoned cart email is one of the most useful. If a lead makes it all the way to the end of your sales funnel, is ready to check out and does not complete the purchase, don\u2019t fret! There is still a chance that you can <a href=\"\/blog\/4-sales-email-templates-conversions\/\">save this conversion<\/a> from falling flat.<\/p>\n<p>When this happens, you should have an abandoned cart email campaign set up and ready to go at this trigger. Not only will this remind your potential customer that they have an item in their cart, but it will also give you the chance to offer an incentive. Many people abandon their online shopping carts because the total price ended up being too high. By offering free shipping or a discount, you have a better chance of boosting your sales rate.<\/p>\n<p>SharpSpring\u2019s email marketing automation platform can help your business grow. <a href=\"\/contact-us\/\">Talk to us<\/a> or <a href=\"\/get-a-demo\/\">get a demo<\/a> today!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contrary to what you may have heard, email is far from dead.
