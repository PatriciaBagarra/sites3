Business owners and marketers have turned to inbound marketing strategies for small businesses to ensure they remain competitive.<\/p>\n<p>The results of outbound marketing techniques may seem similar to inbound marketing strategies for those who are unfamiliar with the differences between the two. In this blog, we\u2019ll discuss the possible reasons why you should adopt inbound marketing for <a href=\"\/blog\/is-your-b2b-company-ready-for-marketing-automation\/\">your small business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To review, here&#8217;s a great video overview of Inbound vs. Outbound Marketing:<br \/>\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/394518262\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Benefits of Inbound Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s delve into the specifics of inbound marketing strategies for small businesses:<\/p>\n<h3>Generate leads<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike outbound marketing strategies that involve broadcasting a message to a passive audience, <a href=\"\/blog\/top-5-inbound-trends-2017\/\">inbound marketing<\/a> is all about advertising products and services to consumers who are already interested in what you have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>One way of achieving this is by doing a follow-up on people who have already shown interest by, for instance, clicking or watching a video you had posted. These are people that can easily turn to leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Generate more sales<\/h3>\n<p>As we stated earlier, inbound marketing generates more qualified leads, which is great. However, a business owner or marketer has to follow up on the potential leads, close them to boost sales. Furthermore, what\u2019s the importance of generating leads if you cannot convert them into sales?<\/p>\n<p>With inbound marketing, especially on social media, you can acquire new customers most of whom will respond to the brands they see on a platform and purchase their products and services.<\/p>\n<h3>Help in building brand awareness<\/h3>\n<p>All entrepreneurs realize how difficult it is for consumers to purchase products and services from companies they have never heard of before. It is for this reason that business owners will sell their brand by word of mouth, as it is still a very powerful marketing tool.<\/p>\n<p>Inbound marketing is often a more effective marketing tool compared to certain popular tactics, such as television and radio advertisements. Why is this? Because inbound marketing focuses on relationship building. As such, marketers can narrow their focus on a particular niche of interested parties. Instead of casting your net into unpredictable waters, inbound strategies allow you to build trustworthy relationships with individuals that are interested in your products and services.<\/p>\n<h3>Has a higher return on investment (ROI)<\/h3>\n<p>One positive aspect of inbound marketing that cannot be ignored is the fact that it is often cheaper than traditional outbound strategies.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, television and radio adverts are expensive for a business. However, inbound tactics like social media are often free or inexpensive.<\/p>\n<p>This low advertising rate will increase the value of each sale, significantly increasing your return on investment.<\/p>\n<h3>It saves time<\/h3>\n<p>Inbound marketing strategies are cost-effective. They lower the amount of money you spend on your marketing efforts. This, in turn, saves you and your team time by increasing productivity and efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, with the recent advancements in technology, marketing is now highly automated. For instance, an inbound marketing strategy like e-mail marketing facilitates engagement between a company and its consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Another good example is using a chatbot service. These services are used to enhance customer interactions even when you are not available to answer basic customer queries or inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>With inbound marketing strategies, you are better able to prioritize your time and go after highly qualified leads.<\/p>\n<h2>Builds trust and relationships<\/h2>\n<p>Most inbound marketing strategies focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.impactbnd.com\/blog\/inbound-marketing-vs-outbound-marketing\">building trust and lasting relationships<\/a> with their clients. As opposed to outbound strategies, inbound marketing focuses on the importance of dialogue with potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>It is, basically, interacting with potential clients, answering their questions, and telling them more about their products and services. Also, by providing your consumers with quality content, you establish authority and they learn to trust your brand and expertise. This trust develops way before they are interested in what you have to offer or before they contact one of your salespeople.<\/p>\n<p>The more potential consumers believe and trust in your brand, the more quality leads you will gain and the more the sales can be closed.
