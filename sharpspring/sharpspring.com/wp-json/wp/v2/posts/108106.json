That\u2019s why programmers are paid big money to code websites, programs, emails, and yes, landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>We here at SharpSpring believe that you shouldn\u2019t have to know how to code to use all aspects of your <a href=\"\/features\/\">marketing automation platform<\/a>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><br \/>\nEarlier this year, we launched a powerful drag-and-drop <a href=\"\/blog\/sharpspring-launches-new-landing-page-and-blog-builder\/\">landing page builder<\/a>, and we\u2019ve now upped the ante by letting you make the landing pages dynamic without writing code. Simply put, you can leverage existing lead data captured in SharpSpring to build web pages that display different text, images and calls to action based on individual lead attributes and interests.<b> <\/b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><b><br \/>\n<!--\n<\/b>Check out the video below to see dynamic landing page in action\u2026then read on to see how we did it.\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/182751787\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe> --><\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Create One Page That Adapts to Different Visitors \u2013 No Coding Required<\/h2>\n<p>In the past, something as powerful as dynamic pages would have required a complex workflow of different landing pages to broadly segment your leads into \u201cmost-likely\u201d groups. Thanks to the dynamic landing pages feature, however, that complex series of workflows and if\/then tests can be left in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Now you can set up <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one<\/span> page that adapts to any number of user personas. Simply create dynamic rules based on robust visitor profiles \u2013 so users only see content that\u2019s tailored to their specific attributes. Once your rules are in place, click on the individual landing page elements \u2013 text, images, headers, videos \u2013 and select which content should appear for which user types, without any coding.<\/p>\n<p>Dynamic landing pages are a high-converting method and can help you get a lot more out of any campaign. Your leads will be far more likely to engage with you, and ultimately make a purchase, if your webpages address specific things they\u2019ve done, places they\u2019ve been and things they like.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a travel agency wants to improve its conversion rates, it can use dynamic landing pages to offer its clients new travel ideas based on the places they\u2019ve already visited. The<br \/>\nNow you can set up <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exact same landing page<\/span> can be used for any client who has previously traveled with the agency (or even new clients, if they\u2019ve provided any relevant information on their previous travels). By creating a rule based on \u201cpreferred type of destination,\u201d the agency can set the page to display exactly the right content for each visitor.<\/p>\n<p>If a client has visited the Rocky Mountains, it\u2019s safe to assume he\/she has a preference for visiting mountainous destinations. So when the client revisits the travel agency\u2019s website, the main landing page could display an offer for another similar trip-in this case to the Alps.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/image1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8108 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/image1.png\" alt=\"image1\" width=\"543\" height=\"403\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Similarly, for clients who prefer more tropical destinations, the page can reference where they\u2019ve been before and suggest another similar location, like in the image below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/image222.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8107 aligncenter\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/image222.png\" alt=\"image2\" width=\"528\" height=\"393\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Truly Take Advantage of Your Data<\/h2>\n<p>Another way you can leverage your data is by basing the content a given lead will see on his\/her lead score. In other words, you can create a single landing page page that will display one of multiple possible options depending on whether a lead is above or below a specified threshold. For example, you can set it so that new visitors with lower lead scores will see an option to download an ebook acquainting them with your product or service. For previous visitors whose lead scores match or exceed the specified lead score threshold, the same page can display a discount or demo offer for your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>This is all based on the data that SharpSpring has collected on your leads over time, allowing you to take full advantage of that data and personalize your campaigns like never before.<\/p>\n<h2>And One More Thing\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>All this power is coming to email.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, soon one email will be able to adapt to each lead automatically \u2013 just like your landing pages. While this function has been possible for a while, some coding was always required to be able to fully take advantage of it. Soon you\u2019ll be able to easily create dynamic emails using point and click, so you can completely forget about coding.
