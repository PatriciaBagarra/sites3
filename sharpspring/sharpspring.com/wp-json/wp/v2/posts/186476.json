But how do you outline what actions, specifically, your team should take to close the deal?<\/p>\n<p>SharpSpring Sales Optimizer ensures every salesperson follows best practices for conversion by automatically creating tasks and actions that move opportunities through the pipeline. This suite of tools is designed to give you control over both the cadence and quality of sales communication in ways never before possible.<\/p>\n<h2>A Canvas for Your Sales Masterpiece<\/h2>\n<p>Getting rid of those headaches starts with designing your ideal sales process in the visual workflow builder, a tool that empowers you to easily outline every step your team needs to take, from opportunity creation to a closed-won sale.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-186519\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Workflow_R3-1024x987.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"422\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Workflow_R3-1024x987.png 1024w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Workflow_R3-300x289.png 300w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Workflow_R3-768x741.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Your sales team now has access to the same powerful automation tools the marketing team uses, so they can convert those hard-earned leads to sales.<\/p>\n<p>Workflows not only allow you to delegate how and when tasks are executed, but you can also automate actions like creating an opportunity and moving a deal to a new pipeline stage. Automatically generate new opportunities based on a hot lead\u2019s engagement with your content, or move an opportunity to a new pipeline stage after they submit a signed contract. Allow automation to fill in the gaps and keep leads engaged without a second thought.<\/p>\n<p>This enables your team to spend less time on the admin work involved in pipeline management so they can focus on what really matters \u2013 winning deals.<\/p>\n<h2>Manage Your Message<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve painted your horizon in an opportunity workflow, it\u2019s time to add the little details that really seal the deal. When assigning actions in your workflow, you can easily control what emails and media center assets your salesperson sends out. With every auto-assigned sales task, you can link the specific email template they should send and any content assets relevant to that stage in the buyer\u2019s journey. This makes it easy to align sales communication with the marketing team\u2019s content strategy, so you have ultimate control over the message you want to convey.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-186620\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-4_R6-08.png\" alt=\"Sales Optimizer Task Manager\" width=\"3221\" height=\"1755\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-4_R6-08.png 3221w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-4_R6-08-300x163.png 300w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-4_R6-08-768x418.png 768w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-4_R6-08-1024x558.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3221px) 100vw, 3221px\" \/>Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s still room for your salesperson to add their own flair \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t automate a personal connection. From the Task Manager, the salesperson will have the option to send a Smart Mail template as-is or go into the email editor and customize it for a particular lead.<\/p>\n<h2>Streamline Task Management<\/h2>\n<p>Having a more personal touch in your messaging is important for one-to-one engagement, but manually creating these repetitive phone and email tasks leaves too much room for human error. One missed follow-up email or phone call, and a sales-ready opportunity could fall through the cracks. With Sales Optimizer, rest assured that all your leads and opportunities are properly managed with the exact cadence you\u2019ve laid out.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-186514\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-2_R3-03-1024x509.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"839\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-2_R3-03-1024x509.png 1024w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-2_R3-03-300x149.png 300w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Task-Manager-Img-2_R3-03-768x382.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\" \/><br \/>\nFollow-up tasks are auto-generated and flow seamlessly into every salesperson\u2019s Task Manager. Even better, when leads engage with your website, their tasks float to the top of the list so your team can reach out just in time while your brand is top of mind. Sales Optimizer turns your website into a two-way communicator that\u2019s patched in directly with your sales team, making prioritization easy and effective.<\/p>\n<h2>Capitalize on Hot Lead Engagement<\/h2>\n<p>Prioritizing who to reach out to is now easier than ever from the Activity Feed with instant visibility into which leads have automated tasks associated with them. Lead owners are able to see which leads are currently engaging and what they are engaging with, so they can respond accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-186516\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Activity-Feed_R3-1024x523.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"839\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Activity-Feed_R3-1024x523.png 1024w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Activity-Feed_R3-300x153.png 300w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Activity-Feed_R3-768x392.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If a lead opens an email or engages with your social media, this not only shows up in real-time on the Activity Feed, but it\u2019s also highlighted when the lead owner has a follow-up task. This way it\u2019s easy to time your sales follow-up at pivotal moments in the buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Your Team Accountable<\/h2>\n<p>Powerful new automation features sound great, but how do you make sure everything is going according to plan? Keep your team on track with detailed task reports that provide insight into which automated tasks are being completed or rescheduled during a given time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-186614 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Sales-Optimizer-Task-Reports_R3.png\" alt=\"Sales Optimizer Task Report\" width=\"3000\" height=\"1588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Sales-Optimizer-Task-Reports_R3.png 3000w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Sales-Optimizer-Task-Reports_R3-300x159.png 300w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Sales-Optimizer-Task-Reports_R3-768x407.png 768w, https:\/\/wp.static-cdn-shsp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Sales-Optimizer-Task-Reports_R3-1024x542.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instantly see if your sales rep sent an email when you assigned a phone call, for example, so you can make sure everyone follows the correct process. You can also identify any holes in your sales plan based on the outcome of automated tasks.
