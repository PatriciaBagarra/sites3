The secret to building a great inbound marketing stack is to find the tools that best allow your specific approach shine. Because no matter how talented and experienced your team is, they can\u2019t do their best work without the best inbound marketing tools at their disposal. So \u2013 without fear or favor \u2013 we\u2019ve listed the 5 inbound marketing services that agencies need to succeed.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 &#8211; Email Marketing That Stands Out<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, we all know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/email-marketing\/7-email-marketing-trends-for-2019-02120824\">email marketing is still the best thing since sliced bread<\/a>. But, as time goes by, consumers are becoming experts in email marketing, too. They\u2019re used to seeing clickbait subject lines, the same tired layouts and the same old dull strategies.<\/p>\n<p>What does that mean for inbound marketing agencies? It means that <a href=\"\/email-marketing\/\">email marketing<\/a> does still work \u2013 <em>if you can make your emails stand out.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s time to move away from using the same three email service providers as everyone else. Look for <a href=\"\/inbound-marketing\/\">inbound marketing<\/a> services which offer their own <a href=\"\/features\/email\/\">built-in email platform<\/a>. You\u2019ll benefit from new editing tools, analytics and a different perspective on email tactics.<\/p>\n<p>A few ways to make your email campaigns stand out include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compelling copy<\/li>\n<li>Attention-grabbing subject lines<\/li>\n<li>Clear CTAs<\/li>\n<li>Illustrations and graphics<\/li>\n<li>Well-designed email templates<\/li>\n<li>Branded banners<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#2 Lightning-fast Inbound Marketing Tools<\/h2>\n<p>Inbound marketing is all about designing experiences which suit the customer \u2013 not the brand. That\u2019s why inbound marketing agencies in 2020 spend so much time on <a href=\"\/blog\/2020-tips-developing-buyer-personas\/\">buyer personas<\/a>, <a href=\"\/blog\/sharpspring-visual-workflow-builder\/\">workflows<\/a> and creating an <a href=\"\/blog\/7-ways-implement-omni-channel-strategy\/\">omni-channel<\/a> experience for leads.<\/p>\n<p>And, in practice, all of those buzzwords boil down to\u2026 Landing pages. Lots and lots of <a href=\"\/features\/landingpagebuilder\/\">landing pages<\/a> and <a href=\"\/features\/blogbuilder\/\">blog posts<\/a>, carefully written to capture every long-tail keyword. A really good content strategy will include information and calls to action for every possible buyer persona and every possible buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why fast web tools are an essential inbound marketing tool. You need the capacity to throw up new landing pages and blogs in record time. They have to be responsive, well-organized and easy to edit.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re shopping around for inbound marketing services, think about the features you need in your landing pages and blogs. Don\u2019t settle for inbound marketing solutions that will slow you down.<\/p>\n<p>You need a marketing automation platform that offers a point-and-click editor to easily create landing pages in minutes without requiring any coding skills. Look for a \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d (WYSIWYG) landing page builder that offers pre-designed layouts, templates and drop-in elements. You should be able to quickly swap out graphics and modify color palettes to suit your brand. You should also be able to optimize your landing pages to load quickly on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Integrations That Suit Every Client<\/h2>\n<p>So we\u2019ve talked about creating emails which look different. We\u2019ve talked about fast-moving landing pages and blogs. Next on your shopping list for inbound marketing tools: Flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>As an inbound marketing agency, you\u2019re going to work with a healthy client list. And as you already know, each client will have their own preferences when it comes to inbound marketing services. They\u2019ll have legacy programs, industry-specific needs or even just personal quirks which affect their choices about their marketing stack.<\/p>\n<p>Your job is to continue providing an amazing service, without making the client re-build their process from the ground up. So you\u2019ll need efficient, flexible integrations for all their software. It might seem counter-intuitive, but the best inbound marketing platforms aren\u2019t the best because of their own features. They\u2019re the best because <a href=\"https:\/\/martechtoday.com\/3-ways-ensure-marketing-technology-stacks-198839\">they play well with others<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on <a href=\"\/features\/crm\/\">CRM integrations<\/a> in particular. There are a lot of different solutions out there, so chances are, not all of your clients will be on the same platform. Look at data security, sync speed and functionality. The last thing you need is an integration that cuts corners.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 Powerful Analytics<\/h2>\n<p>Inbound marketing is all about the data. Data helps you plan your marketing strategy; data tells you what\u2019s working, and what\u2019s not. So you need all the information you can get.<\/p>\n<p>However, big data is also a trap for unwary inbound marketing agencies. If you become overwhelmed by information, then you might as well not collect data at all.<\/p>\n<p>So you don\u2019t just need data and analytics, but you also need <strong>organized and unified data analytics<\/strong>. You need inbound marketing services that can help you filter and sort all the relevant feedback about your marketing campaigns. That\u2019s why it\u2019s worth using dedicated analytics tools, instead of relying on free or built-in analytics, for email, social media and web pages.<\/p>\n<p>Look for inbound marketing solutions that allow you to set up <a href=\"\/features\/analytics\/\">custom metrics<\/a>, filters and campaign labels, so that you can organize data and get a bird\u2019s eye view of your performance. And as we\u2019ve mentioned before, any analytics software you use should have a full set of integrations to collect data seamlessly from other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Other data collection and analytics you should look for include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email Analytics<\/strong> \u2500 Track the delivery, open, click and bounce rates for every email you send out. There\u2019s no reason to keep sending out emails if you have no way of knowing how those emails are performing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Campaign Analytics<\/strong> \u2500 Monitor how well your campaigns are doing with inbound marketing automation as well. This will help you to better understand your end-to-end conversion costs, and it will also reveal your true return on investment (ROI).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Ads Integration<\/strong> \u2500 You need a marketing automation platform that allows you to integrate with Google Ads. This can provide you with valuable information like keyword data and how much each lead costs during your inbound marketing campaign.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Behavior Analytics<\/strong> \u2500 You also need to be able to track every interaction your brand has with a lead. This can include website visits, webinar attendance, emails and even social media interactions. Monitoring customer behavior will enable you to personalize your inbound marketing tactics to optimize your chances of making a sale.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Device Analytics<\/strong> \u2500 Another important part of analytics is seeing what kind of devices your leads are viewing your content on. Mobile-friendliness is crucial to generating sales. So, if more people are visiting your site on their smartphones or tablets, you should optimize it to perform well on mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Web Form Analytics<\/strong> \u2500 Do you have submission forms on your site? The marketing automation platform you use should be tracking those forms too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#5 Client-friendly Reporting<\/h2>\n<p>Now let\u2019s talk about the relationship between clients and your inbound marketing agency. For a lot of marketers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/marketing\/proving-roi-proves-to-be-marketers-biggest-challenge-01367819\">the biggest challenge is demonstrating return on investment<\/a> \u2013 proving to clients that their trust in you is paying off.<\/p>\n<p>So when you choose inbound marketing services, take a look at the reports which those solutions and tools offer. Can you export data, quickly and easily? Can you present information visually, with charts and color-coded reports? Can you give clients and team members access to view reports, without compromising on data security?<\/p>\n<p>The best inbound marketing reports will virtually write themselves. You shouldn\u2019t have to spend hours building your own charts and presentations. You\u2019re doing great work \u2013 so make sure your clients can see it.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up Inbound Marketing Tools for Agencies<\/h2>\n<p>Inbound marketing is full of techniques and tactics that can be easily automated to save you time and money.
