										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent years marketing automation has become synonymous with growth. But what&#8217;s the current state of marketing automation in today&#8217;s business landscape? Many marketing professionals already incorporate some level of automation into their programs. Whether through a simple email drip series to introduce a new customer to the brand, or a full campaign to leverage customer browsing activity and serve up products they’ll love.</p>
<p>Since <u><a href="/features/">automation</a></u> can no longer be taken out of the conversation about marketing, we were curious to find out more. How exactly are agencies managing their needs and the needs of their clients using automated programs?</p>
<p>To learn more, we teamed up with <u><a href="https://ascend2.com/">Ascend2</a></u>, a leader in research-based marketing, to survey a panel of marketing professionals and marketing research subscribers on their current and projected use of marketing automation.</p>
<p>This survey represents the <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/">opinions of the 95 marketing professionals</a> who provide agency services. Of those surveyed, 58% held owner, partner, or C-level titles, 59% of the companies had fewer than 50 employees, and 43% said their primary marketing/sales focus was B2B.</p>
<h2>The Agency Marketer&#8217;s Perspective</h2>
<p>We asked about eight categories to learn more about marketer behavior. We’ll dive into a few of the highlights below but <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/"><u>download the full report</u></a> to get all the statistics to utilize in your own planning.</p>
<h3>Why Marketers Use Automation</h3>
<p>First off, we had to understand the why. Why are so many marketers leaning into automation?</p>
<p>A majority of the respondents chose streamlining marketing and sales efforts and minimizing manual tasks (43% and 36% respectively) as their main motivations. Not surprisingly, a huge <u><a href="/features/">benefit of automation</a></u> is being able to automate many repetitive, time-consuming tasks.</p>
<p>Improving customer engagement and improving customer experience were also high on the list, while some data optimization features rounded out the bottom three.</p>
<h3>Is Strategic Success Being Reached?</h3>
<p>Of course, implementing a revenue growth platform is one thing, but we wanted to know if the marketers using them were seeing results.</p>
<p>Only 2% of those surveyed claimed that marketing automation has been unsuccessful. The overwhelming majority told us that their efforts were at least somewhat successful if not stellar. While success metrics vary business to business, automation can help collect the data needed to show ROI more easily.</p>
<h3>Amplifying the Success of Automation Tools</h3>
<p>Now that we’d established that these tools had been successful, we wanted to know which features marketers were relying on to move the needle. This gave us insights not only into what agencies need to establish automations that deliver ROI, but also which features and services are most useful to users.</p>
<p>To see the breakdown of which efforts or tactics most amplified the success of their marketing, <u><a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/">download the full report</a>.</u></p>
<h3>Where is Automation Being Used?</h3>
<p>Marketing automation solutions can be used to optimize the entire marketing and sales process. And it was interesting to see that nearly eight in ten agencies use it mainly for one marketing channel (78%). More than half (53%) also use it for social media management.</p>
<p>The more sales-driven efforts such as sales funnel communications (24%) and account-based marketing (21%) are only used by about a quarter of the agencies surveyed. This signals big opportunities for growth and implementing new features in the coming year.</p>
<h3>Where Do Marketers Plan to Use Automation?</h3>
<p>Thinking to the future, we got into the year ahead by asking where companies plan on expanding automation capabilities moving forward.</p>
<p>From all the features listed, push notifications and SMS marketing has the lowest percentage of marketers looking to implement it in the upcoming year. If you’re looking to <u><a href="/blog/enhance-your-agencys-service-stack-grow-agency/">enhance your agency’s service stack</a></u>, these would make great areas of opportunity.</p>
<p>The number one feature by far (48%) shows that companies are ready to expand beyond the basics. Of course, as companies become more comfortable with automation basics like email, they get more confident in exploring the other features.</p>
<h3>Using Automation Tools to their Fullest Potential</h3>
<p>Revenue growth platforms can seem overwhelming at first. The sales and marketing process is complicated! Trying to house it all under one system for ease of use for everyone means that your tool might come with additions and features that are unfamiliar or don’t apply to your business plan just yet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that many customers are left with systems that feel underutilized. About 50% of those surveyed agreed that they did not think they were using their systems to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s important to know if customers feel they are using their revenue growth platforms to the fullest. If not, that gives automation platforms opportunities for <u><a href="/resources/">education and guides</a></u> so that customers can feel confident exploring tools and features.</p>
<h3>Significant Barriers to Use</h3>
<p>Since so many marketers felt they were not using their automation tools to their fullest potential, we wanted to understand what was stopping them.</p>
<p>Over one-third (34%) of agencies feel that they are not provided adequate tools such as training, resources, or a knowledge base, to utilize the solutions to their fullest extent.</p>
<p>This is an important point to keep in mind when shopping for a marketing automation solution. You’ll want to be sure that whatever system you choose has options for training and <u><a href="/resources/">access to resources</a></u> long after the onboarding period has ended.</p>
<h3>Extent of Technology Integration</h3>
<p>Integrating marketing automation into your full technology stack is key to delivering well-strategized campaigns. With integration of all sales and marketing tools, teams are better positioned to centralize data and use reporting to run optimized campaigns.</p>
<p>While over half (52%) of agencies claimed that their automation is either entirely or mostly integrated into their existing technology, you’re not alone if it’s not. Optimizing integration can be another great goal for the year ahead.</p>
<h2>Get the Full Report</h2>
<p>It’s obvious that marketers are ready to tackle automation head on in the coming years. Those agencies who have been implementing automation for their customers for a while seem eager to expand their offerings and utilize the tools at their fingertips.</p>
<p>This survey was put together for your use, <a href="/resources/state-of-marketing-automation/"><u>download the full report</u></a> to use it in your own marketing strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the popularity of our Agency Growth Series, we launched Revenue Rockstars — our newest webinar series for agencies and digital marketing leaders. We’re showcasing businesses growing revenue using the SharpSpring Revenue Growth Platform and featuring top marketing talents including Jay Baer, Shama Hyder, Seth Godin, Karl Sakas, and more.</p>
<p>Jay Baer kicked off the series with a live-streamed session on August 5. Jay and Chip House, CMO at SharpSpring, announced our series headliners.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to learn how revenue rockstars grow revenue throughout the entire marketing funnel. You’ll have the opportunity to attend each session live and participate in the Q&amp;As. We’ll also share key takeaways on our blog. Our series will continue through early January 2022.</p>
<p>Our 11 revenue rockstars will solve 11 questions on problems future revenue rockstars encounter. On August 18, Mickey Locey, president and co-founder of mXtr Automation, hosted  “Beyond the Pitch: Rock Star Moves to Not Only Win Business But Deliver on Your Promise.”</p>
<p>Here are some of our favorite <a href="/resources/revenue-rockstars-mickey-locey/">highlights from Mickey’s session</a>. Enjoy and let us know your favorite moments of the series!</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on breaking through the noise to drive real impact</h2>
<p>Yeah, look, I mean, I think when you&#8217;re focusing when you&#8217;re able to identify that one thing which isn&#8217;t always easy to do, right. Again, because there is so much, so many things going on there. What we find is when you have identified it, this really acts as the most common conversation, the center point of your entire strategy as you move forward. Because it allows you to build off that and allows you to then differentiate yourself based on what you&#8217;re going through, because you have this the center track this baseline, if you will, to really focus on.</p>
<p>When we start with a client, when we onboard a client, one of the first things we always do with that client is ask them what success looks like to them. And that helps us get to the root of this one thing. So we ask them, what does success look like at 90 days? What does it look like in six months? What does it look like at one year? As you can imagine the answers for the clients, they differ, right? They&#8217;re different. Certainly, if there&#8217;s one commonality with almost every client, they say I want to sell more widgets, without a doubt. But there&#8217;s other things that come out of that conversation and we&#8217;ll get back to the selling more widgets because that&#8217;s another thing we want to talk about here. There&#8217;s other things that come out of that, other KPIs, other measurable success benchmarks, if you will, that come out of that question that allows us to really focus in on that key factor that we want to make the center point as we move forward. Could be could be something as easy as and as simple as they want to have better connections with their customer base. Could be they&#8217;ve got a small database of customers right now and they&#8217;re looking for ways to grow that database so that they can start to make those connections.</p>
<p>We had one client that told us, look, we&#8217;re struggling to understand our true sales cycle. We don&#8217;t know exactly what it is. We think it&#8217;s X, but it might be Y. So that becomes a focus for them. One of the common ones that we hear a lot is, you know, the last relationship we&#8217;re in the last agency we were working with, our internal marketing team (whatever it might be) we&#8217;re generating leads, but they&#8217;re just not good quality leads. We got to find a way to get better quality leads.</p>
<p>And I think the last one I want to bring up that&#8217;s becoming more and more common with our clients is the data side of things. They want to gain control over their data. Right. And so the list could go on and on and on in terms of other things that they define success as. But when you combine those with all that noise that we talked about at the beginning in terms of the opportunities and you kind of put those together in one thing. It really allows that area of focus to jump out at you, it quickly allows you to understand what that differentiation is and what our opportunity is to drive that biggest impact.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on the secret sauce to sustainable growth</h2>
<p>So you asked me that question when we spoke last time and I’ve been thinking a lot about it. And the reality is that&#8217;s really kind of the secret sauce behind what we do. But the reality is, it&#8217;s not a secret. It&#8217;s not something unique to us or anybody else. It&#8217;s just a philosophy, I think, that you need to make need to buy into. And it&#8217;s kind of an understanding that all things in all aspects of what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish, and what the client is trying to accomplish for their business should focus on one thing, and that&#8217;s the consumer. And this is different than the old “customer is always right”. This is focusing on the consumer. A consumer-centric approach to marketing and specifically with marketing automation.</p>
<p>Our belief, and I say this to every client that we talk to and onboard, and I think it’s hard to argue this point, that there was a day when the idea of marketing was you took your soapbox to town, you get on top of that soapbox and you scream at the top of your lungs all the great things that you do. And people would flock to you to do one of the 10 things that you just listed off. And we kind of carried that through in marketing. And, you know, when you think about the days of email newsletters and sending an email newsletter out with 20 things in it and expect the customer to open that newsletter and figure out of 20 things, what&#8217;s most important to them? That&#8217;s not the way it works anymore.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on creating moments and connecting with your audience</h2>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s right. And so if you&#8217;re doing that right, if you&#8217;re taking that that consumer-centric approach, as we like to call it, what starts to happen as you start to have these really powerful connections? And we always talk about creating moments with your audience. And I think the best part about this is, is that as marketers, I&#8217;m not the smartest guy in the room. I don&#8217;t have to have all the answers anymore. I can start with this one conversation that we talked about moments ago. I can get it in play and guess how I win as a marketer. I&#8217;ve got this great technology I&#8217;m driving all of this data back to. And so now I can listen. I can watch. I can see how that conversation is performing. And the consumer who I&#8217;ve put at the center of my communication is going to tell me what I should do next.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on rockstar agency moves to grow revenue</h2>
<p>We work with a lot of agency partners, as I mentioned. And I and I have this conversation with them all the time. I mean, there is no doubt that if you&#8217;re an agency, if you&#8217;re a marketer at an organization, you have already done the hardest part of what we&#8217;re talking about here today. You have built a website. You have put strategies in place to drive traffic to that website. You&#8217;ve optimized that site to make sure that you&#8217;re getting the most traffic that you can to that site. You&#8217;ve put conversion optimization strategies in place to make sure you&#8217;re putting the leads in the funnel and that you&#8217;re getting as many of them ready for your sales team as you can. So now you convert and a lead enters the funnel. Why would you stop there? Why wouldn&#8217;t you bring that in and then try to continue that conversation and continue having an impact with that consumer all the way through to the sale? We can do that and we should be doing that.</p>
<p>​​That&#8217;s the key to it. Technology puts us in that position now, look, as marketers, we have to make the technology sing, if you will. It&#8217;s the optimization. It&#8217;s the approach that we&#8217;re taking. That&#8217;s the key, the key aspect of all of this. The technology gives us the data, to be able to have those intelligent conversations and ultimately put us in that position to improve with each interaction with our customers.</p>
<h2>Mickey Locey on becoming an iconic revenue rockstar</h2>
<p>Well and I think talk about that short relationship. I mean, again, we talked a little bit about potentially stopping short with putting leads in the funnel and not doing as well. We shouldn&#8217;t also be focused on the fact that we&#8217;re just trying to get these folks to buy from us. Again, we can&#8217;t stop short here. We have to be consistent. We have to be continuing to develop this relationship. I mean, they come in and they buy once super, we win, okay? We can tell the client that we&#8217;ve got some revenue for them this month. But the fact is that relationship is now stronger than it&#8217;s ever been. And the opportunity now for referrals, you know reviews, up sales, cross-sales, I mean, you name it, whatever the next path is for that particular consumer, you&#8217;re in the driver&#8217;s seat now to have that relationship. You&#8217;re in the driver&#8217;s seat to communicate with that.</p>
<p>There is a reason that our communication out of your platform for clients that we manage for any period of time our open rates in our emails are consistently forty-five percent and plus. That&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve made a connection with the consumer. They care about what we&#8217;re talking to them about. I mean, you compare that to a typical e-mail newsletter open rate. It&#8217;s significantly different. And when you have that level of interaction with a customer, you&#8217;ve got them to this point. Just be consistent with it. Don&#8217;t give it up. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. Keep providing value to that consumer. And you&#8217;ll have a customer for life as they say.</p>
<p>Revenue Rockstars is for marketing agencies who want their sales and marketing teams to work together to focus on revenue instead of vanity metrics. If you want to grow your revenue, we invite you to <a href="/revenue-rockstars/">register for our series</a> and add the dates to your calendar to attend the live streams and Q&amp;As.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now there are countless “emperors” boldly making decisions that are clothed in “data.” The terrible truth is that those decisions aren’t wearing anything at all. As a marketer, I live and die by the data, and have found marketing automation platforms like SharpSpring to be the best tailors possible to avoid getting called out for indecent exposure in meetings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-156293" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_124904123-300x200.jpg" alt="New Data" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_124904123-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_124904123-768x511.jpg 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/shutterstock_124904123.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />There’s been an explosion in how easy it is to collect mountains of data, so everyone’s making better decisions as a result, right? Unfortunately, no. We’re collecting more data than ever before, but that doesn’t mean we are effectively using it. The solution is simple: quality over quantity. Remember that with data, more is not always better.</p>
<p>As a data-driven marketer, I regularly present to various groups and my goal is to focus on impactful, real-world data that moves our company forward. In my experience, quality data comes down to three key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">       </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Relevancy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">       </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Accuracy</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">       </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Digestibility</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Relevancy: focus on data that actually matters</h2>
<p>Just because data can be collected and analyzed doesn’t mean that it should be. Start by determining what is really important, and list the key performance indicators (KPIs) for what you’re evaluating. Take a sales process for example: the KPIs may be the number of leads the sales team gets, how many of those leads are converted into sales, and the average resulting sale. Depending on complexity and what part of the process you’re analyzing, you may also want to segment your data further, such as by type of customer (SMB vs enterprise), region (North America vs Europe), or salesperson. Don’t stop there. Give your metrics context by establishing goals for each of them. Set these goals as high as you think is possible, not just at the level of current performance. If you see that you aren’t meeting those goals, step back and look at why you aren’t for each KPI. It may turn out that you set goals that are too ambitious, but take a hard look at why you weren’t able to meet those goals, and make sure the problem is actually the goals, and not the processes, before you lower them.</p>
<h2>Accuracy: because anyone can just make up numbers</h2>
<p>Today’s data is collected from a lot of different sources. This opens up opportunity — and gaps. It’s critical that data is matched up correctly, and that there aren’t big unaccounted for gaps. One solution is to use a fully-integrated platform that pulls all the relevant numbers into a big cohesive picture. If that’s not an option, you’re going to have to make sure your data isn’t full of potholes (or at least know where they are so you can swerve around them).</p>
<p>To figure out where you need to take a little more care, first map out the process you’re looking at, with extra attention on any transitions (a.k.a. potential black holes where data disappears), and note any areas where you have little-to-no visibility. Are those gaps going to derail you, or can you work around them? Sometimes, you won’t really know the answer to that, so you may have to make some approximations and just press on. For example, if you have a hard time seeing confirmations that prospects showed up to meetings with your sales team, but your sales team is constantly telling you how great attendance is, you can approximate that number as relatively high (say 85%-100%) as attendance isn’t a significant leak in your sales funnel. Don’t let gaps hold you back if they don’t need to.</p>
<p>There’s another big inaccuracy in how a surprising number of people look at data. It comes up so often and can be so impactful that it gets its own special mention (and it is really near and dear to my heart). <i>Data needs to be looked at from a cohort perspective!</i>At its simplest, cohort analysis just means grouping the base units of a process by time (at least), and then grouping everything that flows from those base units under that same time period. Sounds simple, right? There are two main challenges: first, data is almost never reported this way, and second, it can be tough to really get cohort data.</p>
<p>Take, for instance leads and sales. It’s easy to show that in April you got 1,000 leads and 200 sales. It’s tempting to say that means that your lead-to-sales conversion rate is 20% (200/1,000), but that’s not probably not accurate. If you have a moderate-to-long sales cycle, the sales in April are likely from leads that came in during the months prior. Instead, a more illuminating approach to determining conversion rates is to track the leads that came in during each month, and report sales that came from April leads under April. Thus from the 1,000 leads that came in during April, 250 of those leads turned into sales, so your real lead-to-sales conversion rate is 25% (250/1000). This takes some extra work, as cohort sales for April will continue to increase in May, June, and beyond, so updates will be necessary, but the value of the insight far outweighs the extra time.</p>
<p>Personally, I cut the time required way down by using SharpSpring every day to get the full cohort picture, since it ties all the pieces of the process together for me. As someone who used to spend hours piecing together data from different systems, I can not overstate how much of a game-changer a single fully-integrated platform is.</p>
<h2>Digestibility: your data doesn’t matter if no one understands it</h2>
<p>Collecting and crunching data is only half the battle. After that, you need to put it all together in a way that can be easily understood. Once you have a deep understanding of the data, you’ll need to package it effectively for others. There are two main challenges that can cause indigestion when it comes to data: volume and clarity.</p>
<p>The line between too little data and too much data can be tough to find. Think about the problems you’re trying to solve, the decisions you’re trying make, and the questions the stakeholders will have. Walk through all three of these pieces, noting the questions involved in each, and see how well the data is able to answer them. If there is data that doesn’t answer any of the questions, does it provide necessary context for data that does answer questions? If not, that’s probably data you can omit.</p>
<p>For the data that does answer the above questions, how well does it answer them? If you have to add qualifiers while you’re answering, such as why certain factors are obscuring the data, that’s a good sign that you don’t have enough data, and/or that you may need to break it down more granularly. Anticipate follow-up questions and see if the data can answer those, too.</p>
<p>Clarity is pretty easy to address, but it’s often overlooked. The two things that contribute the most to clarity are order/grouping and labeling. Ordering/grouping is easy, just make sure everything flows in a logical order (from stage-to-stage, chronologically, etc.). Labeling is deceptive. It seems easy, but that’s an illusion. The biggest issue I see that impacts clarity is lack of specificity in labels. Remember that if you designed the report/dashboard/etc., you have an advantage: your labels make more sense to you than they will to someone seeing the data for the first time. Take a step back and look at it objectively. Then, do a test run with a colleague and address any points of confusion.</p>
<h2>Keep reaching</h2>
<p>Better, clearer data means better decisions, better outcomes, and ultimately, bigger bottom lines. The above is a good starting point, but commit to constantly working to improve the data you collect, utilize and share. The effort has a huge ROI for your operation. Plus, your emperor is getting chilly – it’s time to put some clothes on.</p>

			<p>Emails are piling up on consumers, and cutting through all that digital noise means that hyper-personalization is no longer a luxury &#8211; it’s a necessity. That’s where dynamic email comes in.</p>
<p>Simply put, dynamic email changes based on the recipients attributes, interests and actions. No coding required. Swap out entire phrases, images, videos and calls to action with a point-and-click interface, all based on what you know about your contacts.</p>
<p>Take a travel agency that has to market to thousands, or even millions of people. Creating custom emails manually would be impossible. With dynamic email, your emails intelligently adapt to each consumer. “You loved Hawaii? Let’s plan your next getaway to the Bahamas.”</p>
<p>Increase click-through and conversion by speaking directly to what is important to your consumer. Personalized, easy, powerful &#8211; dynamic email from SharpSpring. Your audience deserves a better class of communication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing in popularity, eBooks are relevant pieces of digital media that businesses use to drive all sorts of marketing goals. Developing the skillset for creating eBooks that convert is a powerful tool for any marketer. eBooks can serve as catalysts for passive income, lead magnets that help you market to your audience and resources that <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/create-value-in-b2b-markets/">add more value to your services</a>.</p>
<p>But the value of your eBook really depends on how well you have optimized it for conversions. Here are 9 simple tips to make sure you&#8217;re creating eBooks that convert to help drive your business goals.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">1. Pick the Right Topic </span></h2>
<p>Successful eBooks offer <a href="/blog/sharpspring-onboarding-content-strategy/">real value</a> to the audience, addressing a pain point and helping to solve a problem. But it’s not enough to pick an eBook topic that offers valuable information. It must also address a problem that people are willing to spend money on to fix.</p>
<p>Start by browsing the current Kindle ebooks available in your chosen category. Are they mostly paid or free? Are they getting a lot of purchases and positive reviews? Researching your market can help you decide if your ebook topic is worthwhile and profitable.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">2. Come Up With an Amazing Title</span></h2>
<p>Your title is an important element to help your ebook gain visibility and get conversions. The last thing you want is a generic title that blends in with the crowd. Take a look at these 3 eBooks listed on the Kindle Store, as an example:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182372" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM.png" alt="" width="1099" height="761" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM.png 1099w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-300x208.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-768x532.png 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-4.00.23-PM-1024x709.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1099px) 100vw, 1099px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All these eBook titles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Are unique</li>
<li>Illustrate the value their eBook offers</li>
<li>Optimize for a specific keyword (“email marketing”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the time to carefully brainstorm different title versions that have all these elements. Especially if you’re publishing on Kindle, it’s important to identify keywords to target and include them in your title.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">3. Proper Structure for Creating eBooks that Convert</span></h2>
<p>The structure of your eBook is the most important aspect besides your title. When people shop for eBooks online, they’re often able to get a sneak peek of the table of contents:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182370" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store.png" alt="" width="1090" height="566" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store.png 1090w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-300x156.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-768x399.png 768w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Amazon-com-Profit-First-Transform-Your-Business-from-a-Cash-Eating-Monster-to-a-Money-Making-Machine-eBook-Mike-Michalowicz-Kindle-Store-1024x532.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /></p>
<p>This offers more detail about the value your eBook will offer. So take your time to structure your ebook and create a detailed table of contents to help drive conversions.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">4. Write and Rewrite </span></h2>
<p>Once you have your eBook structured, you’re ready to write it. Your eBook doesn’t need to be long, but it should offer enough details and resources to answer all of your audience’s questions about your chosen topic. Start with a basic draft, then add in graphs, illustrations and links to secondary resources to offer more value. Perfect your eBook as a resource so you can confidently sell it to your audience.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">5. Create an Attractive Cover </span></h2>
<p>Unless you’re a professional graphic designer or you have one on your in-house marketing team, you’ll want to hire someone to create an attractive cover for your book. An unprofessional eBook cover will never drive conversions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182371" src="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM.png" alt="" width="949" height="654" srcset="https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM.png 949w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM-300x207.png 300w, https://wp.static-cdn-shsp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-3.38.16-PM-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">6. Pick Your Publishing Platforms  </span></h2>
<p>The next step is to decide where you want your eBook to be published. You will likely publish it to your website — this is a good choice if you’re using the eBook as a lead magnet or simply don’t want to associate with third party platforms. If you want to get more visibility for your eBook, you can also publish it on a platform like Amazon Kindle, Kobo Books, the iBooks Store, etc.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">7. Format for EPub and Proofread</span></h2>
<p>When self publishing an eBook, be sure to properly format it for the platform you&#8217;ll be publishing on. You can’t simply upload a Word Doc containing your book. You&#8217;ll need to create a special file format with specific line spacing, indentations, headers, etc. You can always hire someone to do this for you. Either way, make sure you proofread your eBook after it’s been formatted for EPub to avoid any strange formatting issues before you publish.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">8. Price Strategically </span></h2>
<p>When you upload an eBook to your distribution platform and go through the publishing process, you’ll be asked to set a price. If you simply price based on what you want to earn, it will be very difficult to drive conversions. Instead you have to look at your direct competition and price strategically. Common eBook prices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$0.99</li>
<li>$2.99</li>
<li>$9.99</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also okay to offer your eBooks for free to encourage downloads and gain reviews. You can raise the price down the road.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">9. Market Effectively </span></h2>
<p>If you want to drive conversions for your eBook, you can’t simply publish and forget it. You need to actively promote it to build trust with your audience and attract interest in your product. Instead of blasting social media with “Buy my eBook!” posts, incorporate it subtly into your content. Reference it in a blog post, recommend it in a marketing email, etc. You can also offer exclusive discounts to leads as they move down your sales funnel, encouraging them to convert.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep on Optimizing </span></h2>
<p>With traditional books, there’s not much you can do to improve them short of publishing a new edition. With eBooks, you can constantly <a href="/blog/use-data-marketing/">optimize and update</a> your work to drive more conversions. Revamping your title, refreshing your cover, or adjusting your pricing could potentially improve your conversion rate significantly. Keep monitoring performance and making improvements to get the most out of eBooks for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve built a great website, you’re committed to telling your brand story and you want to take your lead generation efforts to the next level. While you might be doing everything right from an inbound marketing perspective, you still may not be seeing the results you were hoping for with a sign up form that converts leads. If your sign up forms aren’t getting filled out, the answer might not be changing up your tactics ー it could simply be a matter of redesigning your sign up forms to better convert leads.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for ways to optimize your forms for conversion, consider these five sign up design tips to improve user experience, maximize contact form conversions and create the best sign up forms to convert leads.</p>
<h2>Minimize Your Form Fields</h2>
<p>If your form is a wall of fields that ask too much information or take too much time to complete, users are unlikely to complete your sign up. The best sign up forms have a minimal number of forms and are simple to fill out. Studies of sign up design show that as the number of fields on a form increases, conversion rates decrease — a reduction from 11 fields to four fields saw as much as a <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/?__hstc=182168376.f69614d73b17927ba5f3be77d2ba3442.1567531021028.1576876288016.1577170020288.69&amp;__hssc=182168376.4.1577170020288&amp;__hsfp=4250418031">120% conversion increase</a>.</p>
<p>Your sign up fields need to be specific to your business needs. Regardless of the number of fields, don’t hesitate to ask for the business-critical information you need to drive conversions. While some more personal information, such as phone numbers, might lower your conversion rates in a wider trend sense, you might also find that your individual business sees more qualified leads by including this field. Be sure to test new fields until you identify which ones help you gain the most traffic.</p>
<h2>Make Sure Your Form Is Prominently Placed</h2>
<p>As the old saying goes, it’s all about location, location, location. When you’re laying out a landing page or other web page containing a form, make sure it’s located in the most visible and convenient location on the page. This sign up design tactic ensures that your web users are able to reach out to you when it’s on their mind based on the individual page’s user experience.</p>
<p>Your website footer is a great place to have a simple sign-up form. Keep customer experience (UX) best practices in mind and don’t add too much bulk to the footer if it’s going to dramatically impact your page length. If you’re following our sign up design tip for a minimalist form with only a few fields, you shouldn’t see much negative impact on UX. By including a form in the footer you’ll always know your website visitors have a way to get in touch with you quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>The Best Sign Up Forms Work on All Devices</h2>
<p>Did you know that <a href="https://wpforms.com/online-form-statistics-facts/">45% of form data</a> is submitted on a mobile device? The increasingly on-the-go nature of the IoT era reinforces that sign up design must be mobile-friendly to maximize conversions for both B2B and B2C companies.</p>
<p>The top mistake with mobile forms is that fields don’t display properly on vertically-oriented screens. Drop-downs tend to be more mobile friendly than text fields or radio buttons as they’re easier to complete on a touch screen. Use a top-alignment rather than horizontal-alignment to keep all fields visible on a vertical screen, and reduce scroll time and visual appeal with minimum field heights.</p>
<h2>Sign Up Design Matters</h2>
<p>When it comes to sign up design, there are specific graphic design tactics you can use to make sure your form stands out on the page. Encapsulation ー placing fields and buttons in a colored, outlined “capsule” — helps ensure they stand out from negative space and draw the user’s eye. Buttons are a critical element of any form and need to stand out clearly. If possible, use a contrasting accent color that highlights specific CTAS.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, graphic design decisions make your form stand out from the rest of your page, and your buttons stand out on your form. Provide adequate white space around your form to reduce visual noise. Resist the urge for vibrant colors, bold patterns, loud textures and too many fonts — your form needs to stand out, but also needs to look good on every device and remain consistent with your brand guidelines.</p>
<h2>Optimize Your CTAs</h2>
<p>A single word on your form can have a massive impact on conversion rates. According to <a href="https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-optimize-contact-forms/">research from Unbounce</a>, using “Submit” on your sign up button can decrease conversion by as much as 3%. More authoritative CTAs like “Download” and “Register” saw poor conversion rates and were considered “demanding” by audiences, while informal CTAs such as “Go” and “Click Here” saw better performance.</p>
<p>While your button text needs to effectively call your user to action, you don’t want to seem demanding. Keep your CTA buttons concise at no more than 3 short words. That said, those words can showcase your brand personality ー “Let’s Chat,” “Work with Us” and “Let’s Get Started” work toward conversation rather than demanding it. Test a few different variations to see what works best for your business.</p>
<h2>How to Build a Sign Up Form That Converts Leads</h2>
<p>Sign up forms are a critical element of marketing automation to support lead generation and nurture efforts. The best sign up forms are ones that are easy for your users to complete while gathering all of the information your team needs to qualify and convert leads. Testing and optimization are necessary on forms, as with most digital marketing tactics.</p>
<p>Your <a href="/marketing-automation/">marketing automation</a> suite should let you build forms that integrate directly with your CRM and email workflows to centralize all of these tactics in a single hub, and give you insight into which variations and which sign up forms are truly performing for your business.</p>
<p>Using sign up forms can be one of the best ways to connect with your customers and to build stronger relationships ー and it all starts with <em>your</em> sign up form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite what you may have heard, <a href="/features/email/">email</a> isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, the use of email messaging is on the rise and shows no sign of slowing down. As of 2021, there are more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/255080/number-of-e-mail-users-worldwide/">3.7 billion email users</a> around the world, and that number is expected to grow to 4.4 billion by 2023. With statistics like that, it’s important to stay on top of email marketing trends to ensure that you are making the most out of your <a href="/blog/top-10-digital-marketing-kpis/">digital marketing</a> strategy.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that the very first emails were sent in the 1960s. However, email messaging did not become available for personal use until the early 1990s. Since then, email has become hugely popular and has paved the way for instant messaging and chatbots to come to life. With the technology sector constantly evolving, email marketing trends have changed over the years, too. In this article, you’ll learn about some of the leading email marketing strategies for 2021 and how to utilize them to grow your own business online.</p>
<h2>Customizing the User Experience</h2>
<p>Successful <a href="/blog/understanding-the-purpose-of-brand-guidelines/">brands</a> know what their customers want and effectively cater to their specific needs. By crafting personalized email marketing campaigns, you will have a much greater chance of enticing the recipient to make a purchase than if you simply sent out a generic email.</p>
<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/find-out-reasons-for-unsubscribing-with-a-quick-exit-survey/">33% of email users</a> will unsubscribe from an email list because they don’t want what is being offered. By gathering data and properly analyzing your findings, you can customize messages to specifically attract your target audience to engage based on where they are in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>You can start by creating a <a href="/blog/2020-tips-developing-buyer-personas/">buyer persona</a>. This is a fictional summarization of your ideal customer. Using the data that you have collected, you can determine the age range, location and even the buying habits of your target audience. Buyer personas can help you customize your marketing tactics to specific types of people. If you offer a wide range of products or services, it may be in your best interest to create multiple buyer personas.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished, you or your marketing team can then craft email messages that are designed to intrigue your target audience. You can even take into account where the recipient may be in the sales funnel. An email targeting new leads will be very different from someone already familiar with your brand.</p>
<p>For example, follow-up emails for abandoned shopping carts are a great way to customize the user experience. You can offer a hesitant shopper a discount or free shipping to entice them to complete their purchase.</p>
<h2>Building Interactive Emails</h2>
<p>One of the coolest new email marketing trends rolling over from 2019 is making emails more interactive. This can be done in several ways by incorporating elements such as quizzes, images, gifs or even games. You want to add anything fun that will entice the recipient to engage with the email. Putting your customers in a good mood will help boost your web traffic and revenue.</p>
<p>It can also help with building brand loyalty. If your email recipients are having fun reading and interacting with your emails, that means they will be more likely to look forward to receiving those emails. Also, they may even forward the message to a friend or spread awareness of your brand by word-of-mouth. This could lead to more people subscribing to your email list.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways to make your messages more interactive. A big one for 2020 is the addition of <a href="/blog/5-big-trends-in-marketing-automation/">chatbots</a>. This type of AI technology allows your consumers to ask common questions and get answers quickly. For many folks, the downside to online shopping is that they can’t physically touch the product or see it in-person.</p>
<p>By providing an interactive chatbot that can answer their burning questions quickly and efficiently, your leads will be more likely to commit to the purchase than if they have to wait 24 hours for customer service to respond.</p>
<h2>Narrow Down Your Subscriber List</h2>
<p>Quality over quantity applies to email messaging, too. If you have a large subscriber list but many of the recipients never even open your messages, it’s time to narrow down that list.</p>
<p>For 2021, a smart email marketing trend to follow is to take the time to comb through your recipients, see which ones are the least engaged, and remove them from the list. This will ensure that only the people who are interested in your products or services will be receiving emails from now on. Building a tight-knit, loyal community is key to cultivating a solid online presence.</p>
<p>Not only should you narrow down your subscriber list, but you should also cut down the number of messages you send out. To avoid being labeled as spam, only send out emails at the appropriate times. This tactic plays back into your buyer persona and when your recipients are most likely to read emails.</p>
<h2>Keep Your Customers Data Private</h2>
<p>With approximately <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">60% of consumers being uncomfortable</a> sharing their information with brands, data privacy is a key email marketing trend for 2021 and beyond. You should have a clear, concise privacy policy in place that your audience can access readily. It needs to be easy-to-read to avoid any confusion, as well.</p>
<p>This tactic will help to build trust, and it will also lead to a better system of data collection for your company. If your subscribers trust your company enough to allow you to collect certain types of data, that means they are more likely to make purchases and recommend your company to their friends and family. It also means that they will play a key role in helping you update your buyer personas as your company grows.</p>
<h2>Make Your Emails Compatible with Voice Interfaces</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is steadily on the rise, and in-home devices such as Siri and Alexa are becoming increasingly popular. People are beginning to check their emails using these kinds of devices, so you need to make sure that your email campaigns are compatible with the newest voice recognition software.</p>
<p>An article published by the BBC suggests that approximately <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20190416-smart-speakers-why-your-voice-is-a-major-battle-in-music">55% of Americans</a> will have some sort of voice-activated, smart device in their homes by 2022. If you get in the game now, you will be far ahead of many of your competitors by then.</p>
<p>This strategy also applies to mobile devices. <a href="https://www.emailmonday.com/mobile-email-usage-statistics/">55% of email users check their messages</a> on their smartphones. That number is going to continue to grow, meaning that your email messages need to be mobile-friendly. Mobile users are looking for attention-grabbing messages that have a fast page load speed. Links embedded into the messages also need to open quickly to avoid losing potential sales.</p>
<p>Pro tip: make your emails more <a href="https://sharpspring.com/blog/mobile-user-experience-trends-for-2020/">mobile-friendly</a> by condensing images. Full-size pictures and graphics are unnecessary and cause slow loading speeds. By condensing these elements, you will increase your chances of having viewers engage with your emails.</p>
<h2>Wrap-up: Email Marketing Trends for 2021</h2>
<p>Email communication isn’t dying, but your old email marketing strategies should be. It’s time to change the way you market to your subscribers by making your email campaigns more personalized, interactive, secure and accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve heard of marketing automation but never used it, chances are you’ve asked yourself this question at least once: “Is marketing automation right for me?”</p>
